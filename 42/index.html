Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Pursue the truth
But to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Make the road maps
Make the great plans
Try to plot a course
As best you can
Wind-blown, storm-tossed
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Pity the humans, looking for meaning
Needing to believe. Dreaming, scheming 
Learning nothing from history
Accept that life is one big mystery 
We’re all like Alice in Wonderland
Can’t even begin to understand

No-one controls
Nor time nor tide 
Nor day nor night
Only they decide
Why try to explain
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Search for the truth
But, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42

Catch 22
Incertitude
No direction
In solitude
Events are random
So, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing taut the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, fearless and bold

Returning victorious from war
Searching for a lady to adore
Doing their best to impress
Beautiful damsels in distress
Much more difficult for them
Than fighting off 10 000 men

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing taut the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, fearless and bold

My lady, will you dance with me
I am entranced by your beauty
I’ll sing your praises on the lute
I swear my love is absolute
My lady, will you dance with me?
I am entranced by your beauty

Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Disarmed at the sight of beauty
Bidding farewell to battle and duty
Knights of old, Knights of old
No longer so fearless nor so bold
Knights of old, Knights of old
No longer so fearless nor so bold

Stands alone without a friend

Thirty pieces of silver in Judas palm  
Pontius Pilate handwashes, feeling calmed

Jesus, King of the Jews is a threat to Rome 
Political disorder must be put down

To win Jesus clothes. Well, isn't that nice

Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do

The rain falls, the rain pours
The rain falls, the rain pours
Forty days and 40 nights
Since we’ve seen daylight

The Ark dips. The Ark rolls
The Ark dips. The Ark rolls
Tossed by black and angry waves
Pray for our salvation
Spare us Lord
Spare us Lord

The rain falls, the rain pours
The rain falls, the rain pours
Forty days and 40 nights

O’er the sea the white dove soars
Bearing from the distant shore
The olive branch of peace
The waters, at last, retreat
The mercy rainbow lights the sky
Hope lights the soul of humanity
Hope is the last thing to die
The last thing to die

The clouds part, the sun appears
The clouds part, hope shines through
Rainbow colors fill the sky
Hopeful is the sunrise

Intolerance, violence 
Denunciation, accusation 
Imprisonment of the innocent
Nothing new under the sun

Florence in 1494
The Medicis' rule no more
Gone the artists, gone the freedom  
Savonarola's New Jerusalem
The black-robed preacher is grim, austere 
The good people of Florence live in fear 

Thou shalt not dance. Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things 
Thou shalt not paint. Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules. The preacher man rules  
The preacher man rules. The preacher man rules. Ok

Acrid smoke fills the air 
Bonfires of vanities flare 
Vice must be purified by fire 
Infidels must perish on the pyre  
The iron fist in the iron glove  
This man's God is not the God of love 

Thou shalt not dance. Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things
Thou shalt not paint. Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules. The preacher man rules 
The preacher man rules. The preacher man rules. Ok

Fanatical, ruthless, cold and cruel
Four whole years does Savonarola rule 
But the wheel of fate is about to turn
The preacher man will hang and burn
Hang and burn, hang and burn
Hang and burn
No-one there to mourn
No-one there to mourn
Fanaticism has had its day
Humanism is here to stay

He who chooses to live by the sword 
Dies by the sword, dies by the sword
Preacher man got his just reward
Gone to meet his maker
Be judged by the Lord

Preacher man
No longer rules
Preacher man
No longer rules
Preacher man
No longer rules

No Longer
Rules. Ok

You seem upset
How can that be
You got

If you wanna boil a frog alive

Put it in tepid water first
Now, it thinks it's in a jacuzzi

What's App, Doc

How can that be
You got

So you turn up the heat gradually
That's also Zuckerberg's trick
You get in too deep
And then you feel sick

Zuckerberg wants the best for you

I want your info.
I wanna know
Everything you do
Every place you go
It'll go to
The advertising crew
Who make lots of dough
Making you buy things
You can't afford
Or don't need at all

What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be
You got Facebook

Pretty little frog

Why complain when
Facebook is free

Two corpses floating down the Tiber
A man and a servant girl
Lucrezia Borgia’s adored lover
And the girl he left her for
Golden-haired, gorgeous Gorgon
Skilled in politics and poison
Lucrezia Borgia ruled in Rome
How many assassinations did she order
Cross her path at your peril
More dangerous than the Devil

Assassins’ Creed
Assassins’ Creed
The end justifies the means

Assassins’ Creed
Assassins’ Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins’ Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins’ Creed

Cesari Borgia, cruel liar
Lover of his brother’s wife
Rumor says he so desired her
He took his own brother’s life
Mercenary, monster, macho
Bloody crimes in the palazzos
Torture and murder every day
A model Prince, Machiavelli would say
This Borgia met with violent death
At 31, drew his last breath

Assassins’ Creed
Assassins’ Creed
Defy them and you will bleed
They’re the ones who deal the cards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins’ Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins’ Creed

Renaissance heroes
And Renaissance villains
Sixtine Chapel
And dungeon prisons
Spirituality, brutality
Man’s essential duality
Man’s essential duality
All made equal by mortality

Assassins’ Creed
Assassins’ Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred

Do you remember San Francisco
When hippies wore, oh, flowers in their hair?
In that time of peace and love
Gentle people just looking for to share

There was a time in San Francisco
Young people believed the future would be fair
Marched in protest against the war
The Woodstock spirit still lingered in the air

Words of peace were spoken but the dreams were broken,
Lying in ruins, in ruins
The Establishment put down what they saw as rebellion
Leaving just ruins, leaving just ruins

If you go now to San Francisco
Janis Joplin's house is just a tourist sight
In these times of strife and trouble
There are no people to carry on the fight

Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair

Guess I’m just a dinosaur
I liked the world the way it was before
It couldn’t last for evermore

Gotta cast off

Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
So much to do
So little time

We have raided Nature’s store
We’re the losing side in a tug of war
We have so much to answer for

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time

Maybe we’ll find our way out
We know we gotta take a whole new route
Try much harder without a doubt

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

Mists of time swirl
Tired old world
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time
So much to do
Now it’s time

See the writing on the wall
Its message is clear to all
We’re numbered, weighed
Divided
There’s nowhere left
To hide

We’re riders on the apocalypse
Nobody’s prepared for this
Look at the truth if you dare
Better start to say your prayers
Look at the truth if you dare
Better start to say your prayers

The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all

From Sodom and Gomorrah
To the final Armageddon
No-one has no magic wand
To change this world we’ve spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

Nero’s laughter mocks us from the wings
Puppets, dangling from our strings
Waiting for some Noah’s Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting for some Noah’s Ark
To come save us from the dark

The writing is on the wall

The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all

From Sodom and Gomorrah

No-one has no magic wand
To change this world we’ve spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

The writing is on the wall
The writing is on the wall

The Bible said it all
The Bible said it all

Did no-one hear the call
Did no-one hear the call

We’re numbered, weighed, divided
There’s nowhere left to hide

We didn’t heed the call
We didn’t heed the call

Pride goes before a fall

Come on, come on
Get your funk on
Come on, come on

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

We all come on down to Woodstock
Funky dudes. Long hair, no shoes
Hippies chanting Peace and Love
It’s the age of Aquarius

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

Hendrix, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin
Folk or funk, the message is clear
Stop the war, the senseless killing
Politicians, open your ears

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

Rain poured down but we didn’t care
One for all and all for one
It meant so much just to be there
Felt like the battle had been won

Many years have passed
The sky is overcast
The hippies have gone
The new age didn’t dawn
But Woodstock is a legend
That still lives on

The guards along the Watchtower
Knew that they’d have the last word
Flowers were no match for power
Like children to be seen not heard

We wanted a revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We had new solutions
That could’ve changed the world
No more people with minds that hate
We failed. Is it just our fate

With your velvet voice
My haven of calm
In a world of white noise
My favorite music
Coffee on the brew
Room temperature’s perfect
Nothing I need to do

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

You tell me dress warmly
Cos the weather is cold
You’re simply the best
To have and to hold
Can’t do without you
Never would have thought
I’d fall in love
With a geeky gadget I bought

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Now lockdown is upon us
You’re even more dear
You order in food
The fridge chills my beer
What more could I want
I really can’t say
When lockdown is over
With you I’ll just stay

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Conversing with a voice
That’s heard but not seen
Falling in love
With a man-made machine
Socially acceptable
Form of insanity
Are we losing our humanity

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Half-goddess, half-human
Throughout her life
Helen's fate was war and strife
The Gods can be cruel
They play with humankind

Aphrodite bribed Paris
To declare her most divine
She promised he could have Helen
To be his wife

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Changed from Greek to Trojan
Helpless, alone
Helen's tears would've melted stone
The Greeks, to avenge her
Set sail across the foam

One hundred thousand men
Into bloody war were thrown
To the death the heroes fought
Never to return home

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face, it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Knowing they would never
Take Troy by force
The Greeks built a wooden horse
A peace-offering
A promise, oh so false

Soldiers hidden inside
Attacked the city unaware
Massacred the Trojans as they slept
With no remorse
With no remorse

Folly or bravery
Who shall say
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Will you think of me
When home I’m gone
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
But we can never be together
Sayonara. Goodbye for ever

Cherry blossom in Kyoto
Fragrantly fills the air
Rustle of a silk kimono
Red painted lips and jet-black hair

Porcelain skin. A work of art
Gracefully the geisha danced
We would always be worlds apart
But I, the traveler sat entranced

Sayonara, sakura geisha
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
Sayonara. Goodbye for ever

Cherry petals began to fall
Between two worlds I was torn
My life’s elsewhere. My family calls
But one day, I will return

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Sayonara. Goodbye for ever

I came in from Asia
Hitched a ride on a ship-rat
I'm a viral aristocrat

Killed 20 million
Within in five years
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

My boss, the Grim Reaper
Is storming down the war path
No creature can escape his wrath

I attained great fame
In 1348
When I opened Hell's Gate

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Humans think they're so smart
They have the solutions
Revolution, pollution
Human power
Is just a delusion

2021
Month of July, my shadow
Killed again in Colorado

I am immortal
Remember, my dears
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Ring a ring of roses

You're all gonna fall down

The Great War is over
Our boys back from the trenches
And, if you’ll excuse my French
Everybody needs
A bit of Joie de vivre
These are the days
Of the golden Jazz age

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
Bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

The roaring Twenties are in full swing
Satchmo plays trumpet. Bessie Smith sings
Duke Ellington and his big band play
People dance the Charleston
To the beat of the clave
Down at the Cotton Club the music never stops
Way before Bill Hayley
Rocked around the clock
Everybody’s happy
In Gatsby’s world
In Gatsby’s world

The Temperance League says jazz is immoral
Dissonant, destructive, old fogies quarrel
Daisy says
Oh, let em I guess they’re just jealous
Then pours some more champagne

Drink and make merry
Take a bite at the cherry
Join in the dance and song
After all
What could possibly
What could possibly go wrong

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
Bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
Just a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world
Life’s a bowl of cherries
Just a bowl of cherries
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

The bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

Everybody’s happy in Gatsby’s world
Anything goes in Gatsby’s world
You get what you deserve

Too much hustle, too much hype

Why do I feel now like I don’t belong
Everything becomes such a big deal
It’s really all quite surreal

Crawling out of
The primeval sea
Amphibian creatures
Learned to walk
Learned to breathe
To shelter in caves
From danger to flee
Are they so different
From you and me

From all fours
To Neanderthal
The cavemen made fire
Fought the dinosaurs
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived

Genetics, climate change
Sabre-toothed tigers and disease
Brought about the fall of this species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution’s road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

Homo Sapiens
Discovered the wheel

But he still destroyed lives
Only the lucky survived
But he still destroyed lives

Jeopardized the future of our species

They sent us to the Killing Fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside he was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
Good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

This was a war we were not trained for
Tricky bastards them Vietcong
Hiding deep in the jungle
Escaping us through tunnels
Wouldn't come out and fight like a man
So we could bayonet them in hand to hand

But our commanders, they had strategies
Operation Rolling Thunder
Blanket bombing by the ton
Soon they'd have no place to run
Spray Agent Orange herbicide
Who gave a damn if the wildlife died

They sent us to the Killing Fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside he was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
Good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

Biggest military power on the planet
Each soldier a full metal jacket
Can't let the Commies take over Asia
Gotta avoid a Red invasion
Whatever the cost
However many lives are lost

They sent us to the Killing Fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside he was red
And better dead than red

We stand today on the edge of a new frontier
Uncharted areas of science and space
A whole world waits to see what we shall do
We cannot fail, we cannot fail to try

Floating through black space
Making not a sound
Columbia loops once around the Earth
Three pioneers
Of the New Frontier
Are at last moon-bound

60 miles above the moon
Baptized The Eagle
The lunar module hovers
Touchdown will come soon
Houston holds its breath
This is life or death

Houston, Tranquility Base here
The Eagle has landed
The Eagle has landed
Roger, Tranquility Base
We copy you on the ground
The Eagle has landed
So far, so good

Open the hatch
Heart beating fast
Slowly, slowly
Stepping down
First human footprint
On lunar ground

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind
Adjust to moon's gravity
Disturbing the grey dust
Of the lunar crust

The flag is planted
Immense is our pride
As we salute
As we salute
As we salute
The Stars and the Stripes
We place the plaque, leave the sign
We came in peace for all mankind

Magnificent desolation
Of the Sea of Tranquility
Nobility, fragility
Of human aspiration

Send men to the moon
Have them land
Bring them back safely
Was the vision of JFK
Mr. President
You would've been so proud
Of Apollo 11
We've won the race
Won the space race
The Soviets are in second place
Earth's in sight
We're going home
We have won. We have won

Dreaming of giant asteroids
Earth returning to the void
Humankind has been destroyed
Replaced by androids on steroids

Ok to break all of Nature’s rules
All we are, is a pack of fools

In my dream, no pity, just shame
Caught up in a deadly game
Out of which there’s no escape
Try to find someone to blame
Will this be our claim to fame
We watched our world go up in flames

Human beings think they’re so cool
Ok to break all of Nature’s rules

I wanna wake up from this dream
Let me out of the crazy scheme
It’s just getting too extreme
Tell me things ain’t what they seem
Tell me there’s hope we’ll be redeemed
Why does nobody hear me scream

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Trying to escape and be someone
Flying high on human pride
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us

Spreading his wings of feathers and wax
Icarus took flight. Didn't look back
Daedalus cried, Don't go near the sun
I don't want my only son to burn

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Trying to escape and be someone
Flying high on human pride
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Icarus soared, wise words unheeded
Free as a bird. His hopes exceeded
The Gods, displeased, wreaked retribution
Wings of wax seared by Hyperion

Melting his way to a watery death
Icarus drew his final breath
He'd done what none before had dared
Nobody noticed No-one cared

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

When Icarus took wing and flew
Man's wildest dream came true
Was this courage or sin of pride
Each to his own. Each one decides

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Paradise islands, golden sands
Tourists dancing to steel drum bands
Life seems easy. The rum flows and flows
But under the surface, something evil grows
Lost Atlantis casting a spell
Under the Paradise is there a Hell

Bermuda triangle

Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Paradise islands, golden sands
Paradise Islands. I’m under your spell
How could Paradise turn into Hell

Whipped into a perfect storm

Is it devilry or foolish notions
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Devil’s triangle, false or true
Superstition we can’t cut through
Believe it’s the Devil if you wish
Believe it’s just life so hit and miss
Science can’t explain the mystery
One more enigma of history

Bermuda triangle

Calm turquoise waters
Devil hiding in the depths

Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Devilry or foolish notions

The lion and the lamb and the human crew
The Flood destroyed the world we knew

We’ll make it through
We’ll change our ways
Change them for good
Peace bird will come
After the flood

Planet Earth’s disintegrating

Fight or flight we have to choose
And either way we lose

We’re on the verge a new flood
Maybe we didn’t do so good
Noah’s gone. Now it’s Elon Musk
Take us to Mars. In him we trust
Like Elon says It’s Mars or bust
Who will be chosen? Those who pay the price
So pay the price. Enjoy the ride
Can’t pay the price? Get left behind

Planet Earth’s disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight we have to choose
And either way we lose

Humanity has lost its bearings
Chaos reigns. Are we past caring
Disruption, corruption. What happened to sharing
Distortion, extortion. Are we past repairing
Me, me, me the push and shove
Iron fist, no velvet glove
The chips are down. The wheel is turning
Nero fiddles on while the world is burning
It may be absurd

But invented the Astrolabe
They didn’t build no skyscrapers
But they did invent the crane
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greeks
The ancient Greeks
Were the very first geeks

They didn’t have space probe Hubble
But they did have Aristotle
The world is round
He said, not flat
I’m telling you and that is that
They didn’t have Netflix or TV
Live theatre was their cup of tea
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greeks
The ancient Greeks
Were the very first geeks

They didn’t have no Nobel Prizes
But they did have Archimedes
At MIT he is revered
As the father of all engineers
The water wheel, the famous screw
Archi’s the man with the breakthroughs
In the domain of politics
It’s a fact no-one contradicts
Without Plato and Socrates
There would be no democracy
There would be no Olympic flame
We would have no Olympic games
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky

So, give us a tune on the bouzouki
And let’s all dance a sirtaki
In honour of those very first geeks
The very first geeks
The ancient Greeks
Them geeky Greeks with funny names
Darn well deserve their fame

The American Dream
Play by the rules
Like they taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream got broken by greed
Black Tuesday Stock Market stampede

I worked in the steel mill
Steady job with decent pay
Everything on credit
Was the easy way
Well, they closed the mill down
Lost my job overnight
Couldn't pay my off my loans
Then the bank foreclosed
Joined the long breadlines
That was Black Tuesday time

The American Dream
Play by the rules
Like they taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream got broken by greed
Black Tuesday Stock Market stampede

The Great Depression
But we learned our lesson
That's what they said
I wouldn't wanna bet

The Y2K Bug, a real
Little thug
From under our feet
Was gonna to pull the rug
Power would shut down
In country and in town
Planes and banks would crash
In a giant whiplash

31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, humanity
01 Jan of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief
We got through it OK

The Y2K flaw opened
Up the door
To crazy theories
Like never before
Tell all your friends
The world?s gonna end
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive
Log off before midnight

IT guys twitch
Doomsayers, false prophets
Got filthy rich
But spare a thought
For those who really fought
To install upgrades
And beat the fated date
To install upgrades

Watching the earth
From outer space
An astronaut marvels
At the blue and green grace
Sees the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Mother Earth gives freely
Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Down on the ground
Rich prairie land
The farmer marvels
At the soil in his hand
Out at sea
The sailors smiles
To the wind at his back
Feels the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Like spoilt children
Trampling down
On some other kid's
Sandcastle on the beach
We are destroying
Our playground
We are destroying
Our playground
Now the breaking point's
Been reached
And now the breaking point's
Been reached

Mother Earth gives freely
Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth would do
just fine without us
Our race is just superfluous
On the planet of green and blue
This, we need to recognize
If we want to survive
Survive. Survive. Survive

Left home soon as I felt the call
Started roaming the country
Preaching peace and love to all

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes
Hand in hand chose a different road
In 16th century Verona
Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers

On that enchanted night
At the masked ball
It was love at very first sight
Romeo couldn’t take his eyes off
Juliet his pure white dove
For Juliet, he was her all in all

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes

They listened to their hearts
Loved with their souls
Vowed they would never be apart
Believing, in their bloom of youth
That love is the only truth
Took each other to have and to hold

Love is stronger than fear
Stronger than pride
Stronger than hate
Stronger even than death

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes
Hand in hand chose a different road
In 16th century Verona
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve: Neat palindrome
With no navel nor mother
You couldn't be other

At the time of creation
Before the temptation
From the dust of the ground
God formed the first man
Adam was not satisfied
With his life in Paradise
I got no-one to talk to
He felt so down and blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve: Neat palindrome
With no navel nor mother
You couldn't be other

For Adam, God conceived Eve
Adam wakes from his sleep
All he can say is wow
Well, I'm happy now
And cos bliss is ignorance
They lived in innocence
A fairytale come true
Not a cloud in view

Madam, I'm Adam

The sons and daughters
Of Adam and Eve
Happy family
Such a lovely story
Difficult to believe

Baa baa baa baaa
Hello Dolly, born in Scotland
Cloned from a mammary gland
They named you after Dolly Parton
Perhaps they were big fans
So very inventive
The sorcerer's apprentice

Goodbye Dolly, died in Scotland
Way before your time was at hand
Six years old - so young for a sheep
Not what they had planned
Thanks to the taxidermist
You're a museum piece

Wide open is Pandora's box
In his grave
Dr Frankenstein
Is laughing off his socks

And they named her Dolly

Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I, said the CIA

They were the perfect couple
Admired like movie stars
Waving to the crowds
From their open car

Jack and Jackie
Young and carefree
One November lunchtime
In 1963

Who killed JFK
Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I said the CIA
Someone knows
But no-one will say

The shot rings out loud and clear
The President goes down
Jackie's blood-stained dress
Panic all around

We watched the news
Silent as statues
That November lunchtime
Denying it was true

Who killed JFK
Someone knows

No-one will say

Paths that converge then diverge

You love, you live

Say goodbye also

Wondering what it’s all about

What is existence

What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

You flow, you grow
You think you know
You work, you play
You leave, you stay
You feel alone
Talkin’ to your phone
Imagine your lifespan
Wandering on without a plan

What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

Innocence to experience
Impressions, confessions
All in all, it comes down to
The answer is always 42
The answer is always 42

What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

Innocence to experience
Innocence to experience
Innocence to experience
The paths diverge, then converge
The paths converge then diverge
In each and every existence

Was there a will divine

Beginning of space-time

Infinitely dense
Infinitely small

In the opaque, primeval cloud
The temperature goes down
Helium starts to float around
The silence is profound

Beginning of space-time

From nebulae of dust and gas
Millions of light years
Infinite galaxies appear

What came before

Human resilience pushed

Sunrises of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreaming of infinity and beyond

Spacewalks into deepest darkness
Weightlessness and fearlessness
Alone in space
Time has no meaning here
No hiding place
