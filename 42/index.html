Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Pursue the truth
But to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer's always 42

Make the road maps
Make the great plans
Try to plot a course
As best you can
Wind-blown, storm-tossed
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer's always 42

Pity the humans
Lookin' for meaning
Needing to believe
Dreaming, scheming 
Learning nothing from history
Accept that life's one big mystery 
We're all like Alice in Wonderland
Can't even begin to understand

No-one controls
Nor time or tide 
Nor day nor night
Only they decide
Why try to explain
Cos, to many question
Whatever you do 
The answer's always 42

Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Search for the truth
But, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer's always 42

Catch 22
Incertitude
No direction
In solitude
Events are random
So, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer's always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don't know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer's always 42
42
42
42
Go with the flow
42
Accept you don't know
42
Just remember
42
Whatever you do 
Go with the flow
The answer's always 42
Accept you don't know
42
Just remember 
42
Go with the flow
Whatever you do 
42

Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing back the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, so fearless, so cold

Returning victorious from war
Searching for a lady to adore
Doing their best to impress
Beautiful damsels in distress
Much more difficult for them
Than fighting off 10 000 men

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing back the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, so fearless, so cold

My lady, will you dance with me
I'm entranced by your beauty
I'll sing your praises on the lute
I swear your love is absolute

Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas
Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

Thirty pieces of silver in Judas palm  
Pontius Pilate handwashes
Feeling calmed

Jesus, King of the Jews
Is a threat to Rome 
Political disorder
Must be put down 

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Blood money
Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas
Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

At the foot of the cross the soldiers throw dice
To win Jesus clothes
Well, isn't that nice

Forgive them, Lord
For they know not what they do 
They think I just wanna be King of the Jews

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah

The rain falls
The rain pours

Forty days and forty nights
Since we've seen daylight

The Ark dips
The Ark rolls

Tossed by black and angry waves
Pray for our salvation
Spare us Lord
Spare us Lord

The rain falls
The rain pours
The rain falls

Forty days and forty nights
Since we've seen daylight

Over the sea the white dove soars
Bearing from the distant shore
The olive branch of peace
The waters, at last, retreat
The mercy rainbow lights the sky
Hope lights the soul of humanity
Hope is the last thing to die
The last thing to die

The clouds part
The sun appears

Hope shines through
Rainbow colors fill the sky
Hopeful is the sunrise

Intolerance
Violence
Denunciation
Accusation
Imprisonment of the innocent
Nothing new under the sun

Florence in 1494
The Medicis' ruled no more
Gone the artists
Gone the freedom  
Savonarola's New Jerusalem
The black-robed preacher is grim, austere 
The good people of Florence live in fear 

Thou shalt not dance
Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things 
Thou shalt not paint
Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules
The preacher man rules  
The preacher man rules
The preacher man rules
Ok

Acrid smoke fills the air 
Bonfires of vanities flare 
Vice must be purified by fire 
Infidels must perish on the pyre  
The iron fist in the iron glove  
This man's God is not the God of love 

Thou shalt not dance
Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things
Thou shalt not paint
Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules
The preacher man rules 
The preacher man rules
The preacher man rules
Ok

Fanatical, ruthless, cold and cruel
Four whole years does Savonarola rule 
But the wheel of fate
Is about to turn
The preacher man
Will hang and burn
Hang and burn
Hang and burn
Hang and burn
No-one there to mourn
No-one there to mourn
Fanaticism has had its day
Humanism is here to stay

He who chooses to live by the sword 
Dies by the sword
Dies by the sword
Preacher man got his just reward
Gone to meet his maker
Be judged by the Lord

Preacher man no longer rules
Preacher man no longer rules
Preacher man no longer rules

No Longer rules
Ok

You seem upset
How can that be 
You got

Put it in tepid water first

That's also Zuckerberg's trick

Zuckerberg wants the best for you

I want your info
I wanna know
Everything you do
Every place you go
It'll go to the advertising crew
Who make lots of dough
Makin' you buy things you can't afford
Or don't need at all

What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be 
You got Facebook for free
Pretty little frog

Why complain when Facebook is free
Doc, don't you see

Two corpses floatin' down the Tiber
A man and a servant girl
Lucrezia Borgia's adored lover
And the girl he left her for
Golden-haired, gorgeous Gorgon
Skilled in politics and poison
Lucrezia Borgia ruled in Rome
How many assassinations did she own
Cross her path at your peril
More dangerous than the Devil

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed

Cesari Borgia, cruel liar
Lover of his brother's wife
Rumor says he so desired her
He took his own brother's life
Mercenary, monsters, macho
Bloody crimes in the palazzos
Torture and murder every day
A model Prince, Machiavelli would say
This Borgia met with violent death
At 31, drew his last breath

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
Defy them and you will bleed
They're the ones who deal the cards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed

Renaissance heroes
And Renaissance villains
Sixtine Chapel
And dungeon prisons
Spirituality, brutality
Man's essential duality
Man's essential duality
All made equal by mortality

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed

Do you remember San Francisco
Hippies wore flowers in their hair
In that time of peace and love
Gentle people just lookin' to share

There was a time in San Francisco
Young people felt the future would be theirs
Marched in protest against the war
The Woodstock spirit still lingered in the air

Words of peace were spoken
But the dreams were broken
Lyin' in ruins
Lyin' in ruins
The establishment put down what they saw as rebellion
Leavin' just ruins
Leavin' just ruins

If you go now to San Francisco
Janis Joplin's house is just a tourist sight
In these times of strife and trouble
Who carry on the fight

Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair

We have raided nature's store
On the losing side in a tug of war
We have so much to answer for

Time to cast off

I just gotta stop
Livin' in the past
In a world without
Reason or rhyme
So much to do
So little time

Maybe we'll find our way out
We know we gotta take a whole new route
Try much harder without a doubt

Gotta cast off

Gotta stop livin'
Livin' in the past
In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feelin' reason
On the divine
So much to do
So little time

See the writing on the wall
This message is clear to all
We're numbered
Weighed, divided
There's nowhere
Left to hide 

We're riders on the apocalypse
Nobody's prepared for this
Look at the truth
If you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 
Look at the truth
If you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 
Look at the truth
If you dare

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Now
From Sodom and Gomorrah
Now
To the final Armageddon
No-one has a magic wand
To change this world we've spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

Nero's laughter mocking from the wings
Puppets, dangling from our strings
Waiting for some Noah's Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting for some Noah's Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting
God save us

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Now
From Sodom and Gomorrah
Now
To the final Armageddon
No-one has a magic wand
To change this world we've spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Did no-one hear the call
We're numbered, weighed, divided
Did no-one hear the call
There's nowhere left to hide

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

We didn't heed the call
The bell is about to toll
We didn't heed the call
Pride goes before a fall

Rain poured down but we didn't care
One for all, all for one
It meant so much just to be there
Felt like the battle had been won

Many years have passed
The sky is overcast
The hippies have gone
The new age didn't dawn
But Woodstock is a legend
That still lives on

The guards along the Watchtower
Knew that they'd have a last word
Flowers were no match for power
Like children to be seen not heard

Yeah, yeah
We all want a revolution
Just like in Lennon's words
We had a new solution
That could have changed the world
No more people with minds that hate
We failed
Is it just our fate

You wake me in the morning
With your velvet voice
My haven of calm
In a world of white noise
My favorite music
Coffee on the brew
Room temperature's perfect
Nothing I need to do

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible
My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

You tell me, dress warmly
Cos the weather is cold
You're simply the best
To have and hold
Can't do without you
Never would have thought
I'd fall in love
With a geeky gadget I bought

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible
My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Now lockdown is upon us
You're even more dear
You order in food
The fridge chills my beer
What more could I want
I really can't say
When lockdown is over
Will you, out of day

You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

You are so very sexy
My love's inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Conversing with a voice
That's heard but not seen
Falling in love
With a man-made machine
Socially acceptable form of insanity
Are we losing our humanity

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Half-goddess, half-human
Throughout her life
Helen's fate was war and strife
The Gods can be cruel
They play with humankind

Aphrodite bribed Paris
To declare her most divine
She promised he could have Helen
To be his wife

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Changed from Greek to Trojan
Helpless, alone
Helen's tears would've melted stone
The Greeks, to avenge her
Sail across the foam

One hundred thousand men
Into bloody war were thrown
To the death the heroes fought
Never to return home

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face, it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Knowing they would never
Take Troy by force
The Greeks built a wooden horse
A peace-offering
A promise
Oh so false

Soldiers hidden inside
Attacked the city unaware
Massacred the Trojans as they slept
With no remorse
With no remorse

Folly or bravery
Who shall say
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Will you think of me
When home I'm gone
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
But we can never be together
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever

Cherry blossoms in Kyoto
Fragrants fills the air
The rustle of a silk kimono
Red painted lips and jet-black hair

Porcelain skin
A work of art
Gracefully
The geisha danced
We will always be worlds apart
But I, the traveler
Sat entranced

Sayonara, sakura geisha
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever

Cherry petals began to fall
Between two worlds I was torn
My life's elsewhere
My family calls
But one day
I will return

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever

I came in from Asia
Hitched a ride on a ship-rat
I'm a viral aristocrat

Killed 20 million
Within in five years
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
A pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

My boss, the Grim Reaper
Is storming down the war path
No creature can escape his wrath

I attained great fame
In 1348
When I opened hell's gate

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
A pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Humans think they're so smart
They have the solution
Revolution, pollution
Human power
It's just a delusion

2021
Month of July, my shadow
Killed again in Colorado

I am immortal
Remember, my dears
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
A pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
You're all gonna fall down

The Great War is over
Our boys back from the trenches
And, if you'll excuse my French
Everybody needs
A bit of Joie de vivre
These are the days 
Of the golden Jazz age

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
The bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars
We got fast girls
Life's a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby's world

The roaring Twenties are in full swing
Satchmo plays trumpet
Bessie Smith sings
Duke Ellington and his big band play
People dance the Charleston
To the beat of the clave
Down at the Cotton Club
The music never stops
Way before Bill Hayley
Rocked around the clock
Everybody's happy
In Gatsby's world
In Gatsby's world

The Temperance League says jazz is immoral
Dissonant, destructive, old fogies quarrel
Daisy says
Oh, let em
I guess they're just jealous
Then pours some more champagne

Drink and make merry
Take a bite at the cherry
Join in the dance and song
After all
What could possibly
What could possibly go wrong

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
The bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars
We got fast girls
Life's a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby's world

The bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars
We got fast girls
Life's a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby's world

Everybody's happy in Gatsby's world
Anything goes in Gatsby's world
You get what you deserve
In Gatsby's world

I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
Lost in the modern world
Too much hustle, too much hype
Life was easier in black and white
Good guys always won the fight
Life was simpler in black and white

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs
The audience could sing along
But now they all are gone
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Still plays on

I'm a poor lonesome cowboy
I miss my Texas Rose
I miss the range and my hometown
Nostalgia's bringin' me down
The yellow rose has turned to brown
The stars just bringin' me down

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs

But now they all are gone

Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra

What happened to the cowboy songs
That simple world
What went wrong
Why do I feel now
Like I don't belong
Everything becomes
Such a big deal
It's really all
Quite surreal
All we do is reinvent the wheel

Crawling out of the primeval sea
Amphibian creatures learned
To walk and breathe
To shelter in caves
From danger to flee
Are they so different
From you and me

From all fours
To Neanderthal
The cavemen made fire
Fought the dinosaurs
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived

Genetics, climate change
Sabre-toothed tigers and disease
Brought about the fall
Of this species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

Homo Sapiens
Discovered the wheel
Math and geometry
A great chain of events
But he still destroyed lives
Only the lucky survived
But he still destroyed lives
Only the lucky survived

Genetics, climate change
Constant warfare and disease
Jeopardized the future
Of all species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

Big Brother
Now looks after you
Your life is controlled
You're just a barcode
Anonymous lives
Only the strong will survive
Anonymous lives
Only the strong will survive

Genetics, climate change
Heads buried in sand
Ego and greed
Dark is the future
Of our species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

From caveman to barcode
Tribal wars to cyber wars
Can we say that progress has been made

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside
He was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
So good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

This was a war we were not trained for
Tricky bastards them Vietcong
Hiding deep in the jungle
Escaping us through tunnels
Wouldn't come out and fight like a man
So we could bayonet them in hand to hand

But our commanders
They had strategies
Operation Rolling Thunder
Blanket bombing by the ton
Soon they'd have no place to run
Spray Agent Orange herbicide
Who gave a damn if the wildlife died

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside
He was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
So good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

Biggest military power on the planet
Each soldier a full metal jacket
Can't let the Commies take over Asia
Gotta avoid a red invasion
Whatever the cost
However many lives are lost

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside he was red
And better dead than red

We stand today on the edge
Of a new frontier
Uncharted areas of science
And space
A whole world waits
To see what we shall do 
We cannot fail
We cannot fail to try

Floating through black space 
Making not a sound
Columbia loops
Once around the Earth
Three pioneers 
Of the New Frontier
Are at last moon-bound
	
60 miles above the moon 
Baptized The Eagle	
The lunar module hovers
Touchdown will come soon
Houston holds its breath
This is life or death

Houston, Tranquility Base here
The Eagle has landed 
The Eagle has landed
Roger, Tranquility Base
We copy you on the ground
The Eagle has landed
So far, so good

Open the hatch 
Heart beatin' fast
Slowly, slowly steppin' down 
First human footprint 
On lunar ground

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind 
Adjust to moon's gravity
Disturbing the grey dust 
Of the lunar crust

The flag is planted
Immense is our pride
As we salute
As we salute
As we salute
The Stars and the Stripes
We place the plaque, leave the sign
We came in peace for all mankind

Magnificent desolation
Of the Sea of Tranquility
Nobility, fragility
Of human aspiration

Send men to the moon
Have them land
Bring them back safely
Was the vision of JFK
Mr. President
You would've been so proud
Apollo 11  
We've won the race
Won the space race
The Soviets are in second place
The Earth's in sight
We're goin' home
We have won
We have won

I think I'm goin' paranoid
Dreamin' of giant asteroids
Earth returnin' to the void 
Humankind has been destroyed
Replaced by androids on steroids

Human beings think they're so cool
It's Ok to break all of Nature's rules
All we are, is a pack of fools

All we are, is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules

In my dream, no pity, just shame
Caught up in a deadly game
Out of which there's no escape
Try to find someone to blame
Will this be our claim to fame
We watched our world go up in flames

All we are is a pack of fools

I wanna wake up from this dream    
Let me out of the crazy scheme
It's just getting too extreme 
Tell me things ain't what they seem 
Tell me there's hope we'll be redeemed
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Why does nobody hear me scream

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Tryin' to escape and be someone
Flyin' high on human pride 
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Spreadin' his wings of feathers and wax
Icarus took flight
Didn't look back
Daedalus cried
Don't go near the sun
I don't want my only son to burn

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Tryin' to escape and be someone
Flyin' high on human pride 
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Icarus soared
Wise words unheeded 
Free as a bird
His hopes exceeded 
The Gods, displeased
Wreaked retribution 
Wings of wax seared by Hyperion

Melting away to a watery death
Icarus drew his final breath
He'd done what none before had dared
Nobody noticed No-one cared

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

When Icarus took wing and flew
Man's wildest dream came true
Was this courage or sin of pride
Each to his own
Each one decides

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Tourists dancing to steel drum bands 
Life seems easy
The rum flows and flows
But under the surface
Something evil grows
Lost Atlantis casting a spell
Under the Paradise is there a hell

Bermuda triangle
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats
Swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry
Or foolish notions

Bermuda triangle
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm

Swallowed by the ocean

Superstitions we can't cut through
Believe it's the Devil if you wish
Believe it's just life so hit and miss
Science can't explain the mystery 
One more enigma of history

Animals came in
Two by two
The armadillo
The kangaroo
The lion and the lamb
And the human crew
The Flood destroyed the land
That we knew
But Noah said
We'll make it through
We'll change our way
Peace will come
After the flood

Planet Earth's disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight
We have to choose
And either way we lose

We're on the verge
A new flood
Maybe we didn't
Do so good
Noah's gone
Now it's Elon Musk
Take us to Mars
In him we trust
It's Mars or bust
Who will we chose
Can you pay the price
Can't pay the price
Get left behind

Planet Earth's disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight
We have to choose
And either way we lose

Humanity has lost its bearings
Chaos reigns
Are we past caring
Disruption, corruption
What happened to sharing
Distortion, extortion
Are we past repairing
Me, me, me the push and shove
Iron fist
No velvet glove
The chips are down
The wheel is turning
Nero fiddles on
While the world is burning
It may be absurd
But it's all we deserve

Where are we bound
All bridges burned
Where to from here
Where to

What do we know
So little in fact
Why don't we learn
Don't learn

Today
We stand
In a wasteland
Is there a plan
For this wasteland

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

What can we do
Can we still change the tide
Is there hope left
Hope left

Today
We stand
In a wasteland
Is there a plan
For this wasteland

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

Where to from here
Please let the light appear
Where to from here
What's the answer

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden

Great Wall of China
No wall finer
Walls they rise
Walls they fall

Walls, Walls, Walls
Walls of Jericho
Walls of Mexico
Walls that are built of
Concrete and steel
Walls built of prejudice
Just as real
Don't build more walls

Great walls of Yalta
Would never falter
Dreams were made
Hopes were raised

Walls, Walls, Walls
Walls of Jericho
Walls of Mexico
Walls that are built of
Concrete and steel
Walls built of prejudice
Just as real
Don't build more walls

New walls in Europe
Are bein' pulled up
Let them shout
Keep them out

One wall
Comes down
In rubble
And dust
Another goes up
A symbol of mistrust
What will it take
For us to learn
From our mistakes
From our mistakes
From our mistakes
From our mistakes

They didn't have the Internet
But invented a computer
They didn't travel into space
But invented the Astrolabe
They didn't build skyscrapers
But they did invent the crane
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greek
The ancient Greek
Were the very first geeks

They didn't have space probe Hubble
But they did have Aristotle
The world is round
He said, not flat
I'm telling you and that is that
They didn't have Netflix or TV
Live theatre was their cup of tea
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greek
The ancient Greek
Were the very first geeks

They didn't have Nobel Prizes
But they did have Archimedes
At MIT he is revered
As the father of all engineers
The water wheel, the famous screw
Archi's the man with the breakthroughs
In the domain of politics
It's a fact no-one contradicts
Without Plato or Socrates
There would be no democracy
There would be no Olympic flame
We would have no Olympic games
Yeah, those ancient geeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
Give us a tune on the bouzouki
And let's all dance a sirtaki
In honour of those very first geeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
Them geeky Greeks with funny names
Darn well deserve their fame

The American Dream
Play by the rules
They taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream
Broken by greed
Black Tuesday
Stock Market stampede

I worked in the steel mill 
Steady job with decent pay
Everything on credit 
It was the easy way 
Well, they closed the mill down   
Lost my job overnight   
Couldn't pay off all my loans
That's when the bank foreclosed
Joined the long breadlines
That was Black Tuesday time

The American Dream
Play by the rules
They taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream
Broken by greed
Black Tuesday
Stock Market stampede

The Great Depression 
But we learned our lesson
That's what they said
I wouldn't wanna bet

The Y2K Bug
A real little thug
From under our feet
Was gonna pull the rug
Power would shut down
In country and in town
Planes and banks would crash
In a giant whiplash

31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, humanity
Jan 01 of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief
We got through it, OK
We got through it, OK

The Y2K flaw opened
Up the door
To crazy theories
Like never before
Tell all your friends
The world's gonna end
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive

31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, for humanity
But we got through it, OK
But we got through it, OK

The Y2K glitch
Made IT guys twitch
Doomsayers, false prophets
Got filthy rich
But spare a thought
For those who really fought
To install upgrades
And beat the fated date
To install upgrades
And beat the fated date

The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it, OK

The end of the line

Watching the earth
From outer space
An astronaut marvels
At blue and green grace
Sees the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Down on the ground
Rich prairie land
The farmer marvels
At the soil in his hand
Out on the sea
The sailors smile
To the wind at his back
Feels the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Like spoilt children
Tramplin' down
On some other kid's
Sandcastle on the beach
We are destroying our playground
We are destroying our playground
Now the breaking point's
Been reached
And now the breaking point's
Been reached

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us
Mother Earth would do
Just fine without us
Our race is just superfluous
On the planet of
Green and blue
This, we need to recognize
If we want to
Survive
Survive

Left home soon as I felt the call 
Started roamin' the country 
Preachin' peace and love to all

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

On that enchanted night
At the masked ball
It was love at first sight
Romeo couldn't take his eyes
Off Juliet his pure white dove
For Juliet, he was her all in all

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

They listened to their hearts
Loved with their souls
Vowed
They would never be apart
Believing, in their bloom of youth
Love is only the truth
Took each other
To have and to hold

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

Love is stronger than fear
Stronger than pride
Stronger than hate
Stronger even than death
Love is stronger
Love is stronger
Love is stronger
Love is stronger

Romeo and Juliet
Star-crossed lovers
Romeo and Juliet
Star-crossed lovers

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve
Neat palindrome
No navel, no mother
You couldn't be other

At the time of creation
Before the temptation
From the dust of the ground 
God formed the first man 

Adam was not satisfied 
With his life in Paradise
I got no-one to talk to 
He felt so down and blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve
Neat palindrome
No navel, no mother
You couldn't be other

For Adam, God conceived Eve
Adam wakes from his sleep
All he can say is wow
Well, I'm happy now

And cos bliss is ignorance
They lived in innocence
A fairytale come true
Not a cloud in view

Madam, I'm Adam

The sons and daughters
Of Adam and Eve 
Happy family
Lovely story
Difficult to believe

Baa baa baa baaaa
Bravo, hurray for humankind
Sinking into folly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly

Baa baa baa baaa

Hello Dolly
Born in Scotland
Cloned
From a mammary gland

They named you after Dolly Parton
Perhaps they were big fans
So very inventive
The sorcerer's apprentice

Goodbye Dolly
Died in Scotland
Way before your time was at hand
Six years old
So young for a sheep
Not what they had planned
Thanks to the taxidermist
You're a museum piece

Wide open is Pandora's box
In his grave
Dr. Frankenstein
Is laughing off his sock

Roslin cloned
A little lamb
And they named her Dolly

Who killed JFK 
Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I, said the CIA

They were the perfect couple
Admired like movie stars
Waving to the crowds
From their open car

Jack and Jackie
Young and carefree
One November lunchtime
In 1963

Who killed JFK 
Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I, said the CIA

Someone knows
But no-one will say

The shot rings out
Loud and clear
The President goes down
Jackie's blood-stained dress
Panic all around

We watched the news
Silent as statues
That November lunchtime
Denying it was true

Who killed JFK
Someone knows

No-one will say

On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

The mushroom cloud are blossomed
It shook Enola Gay
Like a piece of flotsam
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done
All our duty
Hiroshima

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

Winds like a hurricane
Fanned a great firestorm
Left only charred remains
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done our duty
Hiroshima

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor

14 billion years ago
Before the dawn of time
Before the theories of Einstein
Was there a will divine

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

In the opaque, primeval cloud
The temperature goes down
Helium starts to float around
The silence is profound

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

From nebulae of dust and gas
Millions of light years
Infinite galaxies appear
The music of the spheres

14 billion years ago
The universe was a dot
What came before
What came before
This we know not
We know not

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

14 billion years ago
The universe was a dot
What came before
What came before
This we know not
We know not

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

Singularity has been explained
But science can't explain
Everything

20 years old the ISS
7 astronauts as guests
Orbiting Earth
In 90 minutes
All human resilience pushed
To its limits
To its limits

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises
Of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreamin' of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Spacewalks
Into deepest darkness
Weightlessness
And fearlessness
Alone in space
Time has no meaning here
No hidin' place
No hidin' place

In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres
In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises
Of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreamin' of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Astronauts with a common quest
Human endeavor at its best
