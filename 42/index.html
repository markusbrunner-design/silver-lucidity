Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Pursue the truth
But to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Make the road maps
Make the great plans
Try to plot a course
As best you can
Wind-blown, storm-tossed
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Pity the humans, looking for meaning
Needing to believe. Dreaming, scheming 
Learning nothing from history
Accept that life is one big mystery 
We’re all like Alice in Wonderland
Can’t even begin to understand

No-one controls
Nor time nor tide 
Nor day nor night
Only they decide
Why try to explain
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Search for the truth
But, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42

Catch 22
Incertitude
No direction
In solitude
Events are random
So, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC

Mary and Joe, my mum and dad
They kept themselves to themselves  
It was a quiet life we had  

All the time, when I was a child 
Dad said: Be a carpenter
But I was born to be wild

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC

Left home soon as I felt the call 
Started roaming the country 
Preaching peace and love to all 

Lots of followers, lots of likes 
Had fun with my disciples
Turning water into wine

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas, Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

Thirty pieces of silver in Judas palm  
Pontius Pilate handwashes, feeling calmed

Jesus, King of the Jews is a threat to Rome 
Political disorder must be put down 

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Blood money Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas, Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

At the foot of the cross the soldiers throw dice
To win Jesus clothes. Well, isn't that nice

Forgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do 
They think I just wanna be King of the Jews

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Blood money Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas, Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in Hell he rots
Blood money Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
