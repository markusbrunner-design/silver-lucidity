========================================================

We stand today on the edge of a new frontier
Uncharted areas of science and space
A whole world waits to see what we shall do 
We cannot fail, we cannot fail to try

Floating through black space 
Making not a sound
Columbia loops once around the Earth
Three pioneers 
Of the New Frontier
Are at last moon-bound
 
60 miles above the moon 
Baptized The Eagle	
The lunar module hovers
Touchdown will come soon
Houston holds its breath
This is life or death

Houston, Tranquility Base here
The Eagle has landed 
The Eagle has landed
Roger, Tranquility Base
We copy you on the ground
The Eagle has landed
So far, so good

Open the hatch 
Heart beating fast
Slowly, slowly 
Stepping down 
First human footprint 
On lunar ground

One small step for a man
One giant leap for mankind 
Adjust to moon's gravity
Disturbing the grey dust 
Of the lunar crust

The flag is planted
Immense is our pride
As we salute
As we salute
As we salute
The Stars and the Stripes
We place the plaque, leave the sign
We came in peace for all mankind

Magnificent desolation
Of the Sea of Tranquility
Nobility, fragility
Of human aspiration

Send men to the moon
Have them land
Bring them back safely
Was the vision of JFK
Mr. President
You would've been so proud
Of Apollo 11  
We've won the race
Won the space race
The Soviets are in second place
Earth's in sight
We're going home
We have won. We have won
