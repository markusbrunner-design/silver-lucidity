========================================================

Guess I'm just a dinosaur
I liked the world the way it was before
It couldn't last for evermore

Time to cast off
These rose-colored glasses
I just gotta stop
Livin' in the past
In a world without
Reason or rhyme
So much to do
So little time

We have raided nature's store
On the losing side in a tug of war
We have so much to answer for

Time to cast off
These rose-colored glasses
I just gotta stop
Livin' in the past
In a world without
Reason or rhyme
So much to do
So little time

Maybe we'll find our way out
We know we gotta take a whole new route
Try much harder without a doubt

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop livin'
Livin' in the past
In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feelin' reason
On the divine
So much to do
So little time
