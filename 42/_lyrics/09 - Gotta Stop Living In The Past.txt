========================================================

Guess I’m just a dinosaur
I liked the world the way it was before
It couldn’t last for evermore

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
So much to do
So little time

We have raided Nature’s store
We’re the losing side in a tug of war
We have so much to answer for

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time

Maybe we’ll find our way out
We know we gotta take a whole new route
Try much harder without a doubt

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

In a world without
Reason or rhyme
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time

Gotta cast off
The rose-colored glasses
Gotta stop living in the past

Mists of time swirl
Tired old world
Feeling resigned
On the decline
So much to do
So little time
So much to do
Now it’s time
To stop living in the past
