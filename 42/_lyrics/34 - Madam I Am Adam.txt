========================================================

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve
Neat palindrome
No navel, no mother
You couldn't be other

At the time of creation
Before the temptation
From the dust of the ground 
God formed the first man 

Adam was not satisfied 
With his life in Paradise
I got no-one to talk to 
He felt so down and blue
Blue, blue, blue, blue

Madam, I'm Adam
Welcome to your new home
Said Eve
Neat palindrome
No navel, no mother
You couldn't be other

For Adam, God conceived Eve
Adam wakes from his sleep
All he can say is wow
Well, I'm happy now

And cos bliss is ignorance
They lived in innocence
A fairytale come true
Not a cloud in view

Madam, I'm Adam

The sons and daughters
Of Adam and Eve 
Happy family
Lovely story
Difficult to believe
