========================================================

I came in from Asia
Hitched a ride on a ship-rat
I'm a viral aristocrat

Killed 20 million
Within in five years
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

My boss, the Grim Reaper
Is storming down the war path
No creature can escape his wrath

I attained great fame
In 1348
When I opened Hell's Gate

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Humans think they're so smart
They have the solutions
Revolution, pollution
Human power
Is just a delusion

2021
Month of July, my shadow
Killed again in Colorado

I am immortal
Remember, my dears
The Black Death has no peers

Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Plague from Hell
Endless death knell
Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
Atishoo, Atishoo
We all fall down

Ring a ring of roses
Pocketful of posies
You're all gonna fall down
