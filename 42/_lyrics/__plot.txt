Hey Liz,

1) Woodstock - Hendrix sounds nice
2) 80s Berlin Wall, Chernobyl => 80s is always the best ;-) lol
3) Aids - Springsteen, Philadelphia => ok
4) Events that inspire me => flower power with corresponding music; medieval => but those are very special instruments I can't provide to let it sound like it should; Blues-Time; Elvis-Presley-Time; Start of new colonies in America => some kind of western or like "Apache"

Cheers

Hi Markus,
Nice to hear from you:-)
How about Woodstock 1968? You said you wanted a Hendrix style track....
What about a1980's style for the fall of the Berlin Wall/Chernobyl tragedy?
Negative atmosphere for 1990's Aids crisis - Springsteen, Philadelphia style?

What about you? Any events that particularly inspire you ?
Cheers





Flower Power: inspirations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1tqtvxG8O4. (Pete Seeger Where have all the flowers gone - based on a tradition Cossack song -) This could then be Where have all the Hippies gone? Where has all the flower power gone?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoknj1ebqI Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I0vkKy504U San Francisco Scott McKenzie

Hendrix: All along the Watchtower with words like a hymn ? Hey Joe?
Berlin Wall Think you would be the better person to choose:-). Rush??
Chernobyl something Gothic?
Aids Philadelphia quiet song - good
Love The Shadows:-) Could imagine a John Wayne type character/scenario John Wayne Rides Again, for example

How do you want to proceed now?
I'd quite like to a flower power song so would you like to give my suggestions a listen and see what you make of them?
Otherwise, as soon as you come up with a track, label it and send it on :-))
Cheers!
