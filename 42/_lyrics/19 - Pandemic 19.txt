Pandemic 19
Creeping unseen
Vaccine
Anti-vaccine
Divided we’ve been
Divided we’ve been
By pandemic 19

Pandemic 19
Showed the cracks in between

In a no man’s land
Rumors are fanned
Say our time is at hand
Say we don’t understand

Pandemic 19
Creeping unseen
Vaccine
Anti-vaccine
Divided we’ve been
Divided we’ve been
By pandemic 19

Pandemic 19
Showed the cracks in between

We have been here before
Fought other wars
Got ourselves off the floor
Swum back safe to the shore

Pandemic 19
Creeping unseen
Vaccine
Anti-vaccine
Divided we’ve been
Divided we’ve been
By pandemic 19

Pandemic 19
Showed the cracks in between

So now what can we do
You’re me. I’m you
Help each other get through
Sharing the same values

Pandemic 19
Creeping unseen
Vaccine
Anti-vaccine
United we stand
Divided we’ll fall
Mend the cracks in between
Of pandemic 19
Rage against the machine
Of pandemic 19
Mend the cracks in between
Of pandemic 19
Rage against the machine
Of pandemic 19
