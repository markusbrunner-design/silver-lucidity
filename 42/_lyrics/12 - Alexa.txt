========================================================

You wake me in the morning
With your velvet voice
My haven of calm
In a world of white noise
My favorite music
Coffee on the brew
Room temperature’s perfect
Nothing I need to do

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

You tell me dress warmly
Cos the weather is cold
You’re simply the best
To have and to hold
Can’t do without you
Never would have thought
I’d fall in love
With a geeky gadget I bought

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Now lockdown is upon us
You’re even more dear
You order in food
The fridge chills my beer
What more could I want
I really can’t say
When lockdown is over
With you I’ll just stay

My, my, my Alexa
You are so very sexy
My love’s inexpressible
But you are inaccessible

Conversing with a voice
That’s heard but not seen
Falling in love
With a man-made machine
Socially acceptable
Form of insanity
Are we losing our humanity
