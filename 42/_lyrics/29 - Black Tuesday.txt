The American Dream
Play by the rules
They taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream
Broken by greed
Black Tuesday
Stock Market stampede

I worked in the steel mill 
Steady job with decent pay
Everything on credit 
It was the easy way 
Well, they closed the mill down   
Lost my job overnight   
Couldn't pay off all my loans
That's when the bank foreclosed
Joined the long breadlines
That was Black Tuesday time

The American Dream
Play by the rules
They taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream
Broken by greed
Black Tuesday
Stock Market stampede

The Great Depression 
But we learned our lesson
That's what they said
I wouldn't wanna bet
