Intro 0:10 – 0:52
See the writing on the wall
Its message is clear to all
We’re numbered, weighed,
Divided
There’s nowhere left 
To hide 

V1 0:55 – 1:34
We’re riders on the apocalypse
Nobody’s prepared for this
Look at the truth if you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 
Look at the truth if you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 

Pre-chorus 1:35 – 1:58
The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all

Ch. 1:58 – 2:40
From Sodom and Gomorrah
To the final Armageddon
No-one has no magic wand
To change this world we’ve spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

V2 2:40 – 3:20 
Nero’s laughter mocks us from the wings
Puppets, dangling from our strings
Waiting for some Noah’s Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting for some Noah’s Ark
To come save us from the dark

Pre-chorus 3:20 -3:42
The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing is on the wall
The Bible said it all




Ch 3:45 – 4:28
From Sodom and Gomorrah
To the final Armageddon
No-one has no magic wand
To change this world we’ve spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

Instrumental

Outro  5:02– 7:20
The writing is on the wall
The writing is on the wall

The Bible said it all
The Bible said it all

Did no-one hear the call?
Did no-one hear the call?

We’re numbered, weighed, divided
There’s nowhere left to hide

We didn’t heed the call
We didn’t heed the call

The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

The writing is on the wall
The writing is on the wall
