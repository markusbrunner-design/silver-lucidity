The Walls

Lyrics for Berlin Wall

V1
Lyrics by Elizabeth Auzan for Silver Lucidity Oct 11th 2021
Inspired by structure and atmosphere of Dust by Tremonti

V 1
Great Wall of China
No wall finer
Built forever to last
Yet the enemy passed
Walls they rise,
Walls they fall
Don?t build more walls
Don?t build more walls

Woah Uh

Ch
Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built of concrete and steel
Some walls are prejudice just as real

V2
Great wall of Yalta
Would never falter
Iron Curtain came down
Cheered on by the crowds
Dreams were made
Hopes were raised
Where are they now?
Where are they now?

Woah Uh

Ch
Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built of concrete and steel
Some walls are prejudice just as real

Ch
Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built of concrete and steel
Some walls are prejudice just as real

Outro
One wall comes down
In rubble and dust
Another goes up
Symbol of mistrust
