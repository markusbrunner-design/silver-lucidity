========================================================

Two corpses floatin' down the Tiber
A man and a servant girl
Lucrezia Borgia's adored lover
And the girl he left her for
Golden-haired, gorgeous Gorgon
Skilled in politics and poison
Lucrezia Borgia ruled in Rome
How many assassinations did she own
Cross her path at your peril
More dangerous than the Devil

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed

Cesari Borgia, cruel liar
Lover of his brother's wife
Rumor says he so desired her
He took his own brother's life
Mercenary, monsters, macho
Bloody crimes in the palazzos
Torture and murder every day
A model Prince, Machiavelli would say
This Borgia met with violent death
At 31, drew his last breath

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
Defy them and you will bleed
They're the ones who deal the cards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed

Renaissance heroes
And Renaissance villains
Sixtine Chapel
And dungeon prisons
Spirituality, brutality
Man's essential duality
Man's essential duality
All made equal by mortality

Assassins' Creed
Assassins' Creed
The end justifies the means
Their murders fill the graveyards
Nothing is true
No holds are barred
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
Assassins' Creed
Serving only power and greed
