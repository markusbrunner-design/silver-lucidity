Lyrics by Elizabeth Auzan for Silver Lucidity
Arrangement Cree Paterson

V1
The Y2K Bug, a real little thug
From under our feet was gonna to pull the rug
Power would shut down
In country and in town
Planes and banks would crash.
In a giant whiplash

Ch
31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, humanity
01 Jan of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief
We got through it OK
We got through it OK

V2
The Y2K flaw opened up the door
To crazy theories like never before
Tell all your friends
The world?s gonna end
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive.

Ch
31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, humanity
01 Jan of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief
We got through it OK
We got through it OK
We got through it OK

V3
The Y2K glitch made IT guys twitch
Doomsayers, false prophets got filthy rich
But spare a thought
For those who really fought
To install upgrades
And beat the fated date.
To install upgrades
And beat the fated date.

Outro
The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it OK

The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it OK

The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it OK

The end of the line
For humanity
Be we got....
