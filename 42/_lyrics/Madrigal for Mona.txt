Medieval type song - Madrigal for Mona
Lyrics by Elizabeth Auzan for Silver Lucidity Oct 11th 2021
Inspiration: Nightwish: Walking In The Air

V1
Lady Mona?s eyes shine like rays of sun
(Don?t look or you will burn)
Around my heart, a web of love she spun
(It?s too late to return)
I bear her colours on my helm

Refrain
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.
Beautiful and deadly as belladonna
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.

V2
Lady Mona is a wild flying dove
(She rides on the wind)
True to her forever, I pledge my love
(Or may God punish my sins)
I dream, one day, we?ll be betrothed

Refrain
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.
Beautiful and deadly as belladonna
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.

Bridge
If music be the food of love
Play on, minstrel, play on
That my lady should succumb
And me no longer shun

V3
Lady Mona is a wild flying dove
(She rides on the wind)
True to her forever, I pledge my love
(Or may God punish my sins)
I dream, one day, we?ll be betrothed

Refrain
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.
Beautiful and deadly as belladonna
Noble Lady Mona, ah, ah, ah.
