14 billion years ago
Before the dawn of time
Before the theories of Einstein
Was there a will divine

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

In the opaque, primeval cloud
The temperature goes down
Helium starts to float around
The silence is profound

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

From nebulae of dust and gas
Millions of light years
Infinite galaxies appear
The music of the spheres

14 billion years ago
The universe was a dot
What came before
What came before
This we know not
We know not

Beginning of space-time
One black hole
Infinitely dense
Infinitely small
Cosmic beams
Heat extreme
Singularity

14 billion years ago
The universe was a dot
What came before
What came before
This we know not
We know not

Beginning of space-time

Singularity

Singularity has been explained
But science can't explain
Everything
