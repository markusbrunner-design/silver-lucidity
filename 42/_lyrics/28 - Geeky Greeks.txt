========================================================

They didn't have the Internet
But invented a computer
They didn't travel into space
But invented the Astrolabe
They didn't build skyscrapers
But they did invent the crane
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greek
The ancient Greek
Were the very first geeks

They didn't have space probe Hubble
But they did have Aristotle
The world is round
He said, not flat
I'm telling you and that is that
They didn't have Netflix or TV
Live theatre was their cup of tea
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
The very first geeks
Were the ancient Greek
The ancient Greek
Were the very first geeks

They didn't have Nobel Prizes
But they did have Archimedes
At MIT he is revered
As the father of all engineers
The water wheel, the famous screw
Archi's the man with the breakthroughs
In the domain of politics
It's a fact no-one contradicts
Without Plato or Socrates
There would be no democracy
There would be no Olympic flame
We would have no Olympic games
Yeah, those ancient geeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame
Them ancient Greeks with funny names
Sure deserve their fame

This may sound a little freaky
And you may or not believe me
But I swear by Zeus
On Mount Olympus
The ancient Greeks
Were really geeky
Give us a tune on the bouzouki
And let's all dance a sirtaki
In honour of those very first geeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
The first geeks
Ancient Greeks
Them geeky Greeks with funny names
Darn well deserve their fame
