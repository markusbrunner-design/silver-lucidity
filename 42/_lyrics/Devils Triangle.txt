Intro 0:04 – 0:16

V1 0:17 – 0:52
Paradise islands, golden sands
Tourists dancing to steel drum bands 
Life seems easy. The rum flows and flows
But under the surface, something evil grows
Lost Atlantis casting a spell?
Under the Paradise is there a Hell?

Pre-chorus 0:53 – 1:00
Bermuda triangle

Chorus. 1:00 – 1:36
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions? 
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions? 

V2 (to accompany solo - Humming ?) 1:36 – 2:10
Paradise islands, golden sands
Paradise Islands. I’m under your spell.
How could Paradise turn into Hell? (Spoken?? Whispered?? Repeated?? Scrapped??)

Pre-chorus 2:11 – 2:18
Bermuda triangle

Chorus 2. 2:18 – 2 :48
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions? 
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions? 

V3  2 :52 – 3 :28
Devil’s triangle, false or true?
Superstition we can’t cut through
Believe it’s the Devil if you wish
Believe it’s just life so hit and miss
Science can’t explain the mystery 
One more enigma of history




Pre-chorus. 3:28 – 3:05
Bermuda triangle

Chorus 3 (with space for solo)  3:05 – 4:15
Calm turquoise waters
Devil hiding in the depths

Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions? 

Devilry or foolish notions?
