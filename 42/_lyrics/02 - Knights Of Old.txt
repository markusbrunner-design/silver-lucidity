Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing back the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, so fearless, so cold

Returning victorious from war
Searching for a lady to adore
Doing their best to impress
Beautiful damsels in distress
Much more difficult for them
Than fighting off 10 000 men

Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing back the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, so fearless, so cold

My lady, will you dance with me
I'm entranced by your beauty
I'll sing your praises on the lute
I swear your love is absolute

Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
Knights of old
