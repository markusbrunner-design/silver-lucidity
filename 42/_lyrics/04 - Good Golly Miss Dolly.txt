Roslin cloned a little lamb
And they named her Dolly
Baa baa baa baaaa
Bravo, hurray for humankind
Sinking into folly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly

Baa baa baa baaa
Hello Dolly, born in Scotland
Cloned from a mammary gland
They named you after Dolly Parton
Perhaps they were big fans
So very inventive
The sorcerer's apprentice

Goodbye Dolly, died in Scotland
Way before your time was at hand
Six years old - so young for a sheep
Not what they had planned
Thanks to the taxidermist
You're a museum piece

Wide open is Pandora's box
In his grave
Dr. Frankenstein
Is laughing off his socks

Roslin cloned a little lamb
And they named her Dolly
Baa baa baa baaaa
