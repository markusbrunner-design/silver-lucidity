========================================================

Watching the earth
From outer space
An astronaut marvels
At the blue and green grace
Sees the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Mother Earth gives freely
Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Down on the ground
Rich prairie land
The farmer marvels
At the soil in his hand
Out at sea
The sailors smiles
To the wind at his back
Feels the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Like spoilt children
Trampling down
On some other kid's
Sandcastle on the beach
We are destroying
Our playground
We are destroying
Our playground
Now the breaking point's
Been reached
And now the breaking point's
Been reached

Mother Earth gives freely
Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Of her wild wonders
But greedy men take
And loot and plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth would do
just fine without us
Our race is just superfluous
On the planet of green and blue
This, we need to recognize
If we want to survive
Survive. Survive. Survive
