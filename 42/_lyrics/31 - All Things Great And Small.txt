========================================================

Watching the earth
From outer space
An astronaut marvels
At blue and green grace
Sees the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Down on the ground
Rich prairie land
The farmer marvels
At the soil in his hand
Out on the sea
The sailors smile
To the wind at his back
Feels the harmony of it all
Of all things great and small

Like spoilt children
Tramplin' down
On some other kid's
Sandcastle on the beach
We are destroying our playground
We are destroying our playground
Now the breaking point's
Been reached
And now the breaking point's
Been reached

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth gives freely
Freely
Of her wild wonders
Wonders
But greedy men
They take and loot
And plunder
Provoking the Earth
To lightning and thunder
Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us

Mother Earth feeds us
But she don't need us
Mother Earth would do
Just fine without us
Our race is just superfluous
On the planet of
Green and blue
This, we need to recognize
If we want to
Survive
Survive
Survive
Survive
