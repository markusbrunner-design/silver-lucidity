What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be 
You got Facebook for free
Zuckerberg wants the best for you
Cares about your privacy
Yes he do

If you wanna boil a frog alive
But don't want it to jump and jive
Put it in tepid water first
Now, it thinks it's in a jacuzzi

What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be 
You got Facebook for free
Zuckerberg wants the best for you
Cares about your privacy
Yes he do

So you turn up the heat gradually 
That's also Zuckerberg's trick
You get in way too deep
And then you feel sick

What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be 
You got Facebook for free
Zuckerberg wants the best for you
Cares about your privacy
Yes he do

Zuckerberg wants the best for you
Cares about your privacy
Yes he do

I want your info
I wanna know
Everything you do
Every place you go
It'll go to the advertising crew
Who make lots of dough
Makin' you buy things you can't afford
Or don't need at all

What's App, Doc
You seem upset
How can that be 
You got Facebook for free
Pretty little frog
Come to Daddy
GAFA rules the world
Doc, don't you see
Why complain when Facebook is free
Doc, don't you see
Doc, don't you see
