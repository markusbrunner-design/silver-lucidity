========================================================

I think I’m going paranoid
Dreaming of giant asteroids
Earth returning to the void 
Humankind has been destroyed
Replaced by androids on steroids 
I need to talk to Mr. Freud 

Human beings think they’re so cool
Ok to break all of Nature’s rules
All we are, is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 
All we are, is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 

In my dream, no pity, just shame 	 
Caught up in a deadly game 
Out of which there’s no escape
Try to find someone to blame 
Will this be our claim to fame  
We watched our world go up in flames

Human beings think they’re so cool
Ok to break all of Nature’s rules
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 

I wanna wake up from this dream    
Let me out of the crazy scheme
It’s just getting too extreme 
Tell me things ain’t what they seem 
Tell me there’s hope we’ll be redeemed
Why does nobody hear me scream

Mad, mad molecules

Human beings think they’re so cool
OK to break all of Nature’s rules
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules
