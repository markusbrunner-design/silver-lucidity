========================================================

I think I'm goin' paranoid
Dreamin' of giant asteroids
Earth returnin' to the void 
Humankind has been destroyed
Replaced by androids on steroids
Paging Dr. Freud 

Human beings think they're so cool
It's Ok to break all of Nature's rules
All we are, is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules
All we are, is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules

In my dream, no pity, just shame
Caught up in a deadly game
Out of which there's no escape
Try to find someone to blame
Will this be our claim to fame
We watched our world go up in flames

Human beings think they're so cool
It's Ok to break all of Nature's rules
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules 

I wanna wake up from this dream    
Let me out of the crazy scheme
It's just getting too extreme 
Tell me things ain't what they seem 
Tell me there's hope we'll be redeemed
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Why does nobody hear me scream

Mad, mad molecules
Mad, mad molecules
Mad, mad molecules
Mad, mad molecules

Human beings think they're so cool
It's OK to break all of Nature's rules
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules
All we are is a pack of fools
A set of mad, mad molecules
