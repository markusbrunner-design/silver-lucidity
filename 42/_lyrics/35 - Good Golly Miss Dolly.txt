Roslin cloned a little lamb
And they named her Dolly
Baa baa baa baaaa
Bravo, hurray for humankind
Sinking into folly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly
Good Golly, Miss Dolly

Baa baa baa baaa

Hello Dolly
Born in Scotland
Cloned
From a mammary gland

They named you after Dolly Parton
Perhaps they were big fans
So very inventive
The sorcerer's apprentice

Goodbye Dolly
Died in Scotland
Way before your time was at hand
Six years old
So young for a sheep
Not what they had planned
Thanks to the taxidermist
You're a museum piece

Wide open is Pandora's box
In his grave
Dr. Frankenstein
Is laughing off his sock

Roslin cloned
A little lamb
And they named her Dolly
Baa baa baa baaaa
