========================================================

20 years old the ISS
7 astronauts as guests
Orbiting Earth
In 90 minutes
Human resilience pushed
To its limits
To its limits

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreaming of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Spacewalks into deepest darkness
Weightlessness and fearlessness
Alone in space
Time has no meaning here
No hiding place
No hiding place

In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres
In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreaming of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond
Astronauts with a common quest
Human endeavor at its best
