========================================================

20 years old the ISS
7 astronauts as guests
Orbiting Earth
In 90 minutes
All human resilience pushed
To its limits
To its limits

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises
Of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreamin' of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Spacewalks
Into deepest darkness
Weightlessness
And fearlessness
Alone in space
Time has no meaning here
No hidin' place
No hidin' place

In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres
In the silence, soft but clear
Plays the music of the spheres

Space is black
Earth is blue
Sunrises
Of every hue
Travelling at 5 miles per second
Dreamin' of infinity and beyond
To infinity and beyond

Astronauts with a common quest
Human endeavor at its best
