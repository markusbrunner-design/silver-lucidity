========================================================

Do you remember San Francisco
Hippies wore flowers in their hair
In that time of peace and love
Gentle people just lookin' to share

There was a time in San Francisco
Young people felt the future would be theirs
Marched in protest against the war
The Woodstock spirit still lingered in the air

Words of peace were spoken
But the dreams were broken
Lyin' in ruins
Lyin' in ruins
The establishment put down what they saw as rebellion
Leavin' just ruins
Leavin' just ruins

If you go now to San Francisco
Janis Joplin's house is just a tourist sight
In these times of strife and trouble
Who carry on the fight

Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
