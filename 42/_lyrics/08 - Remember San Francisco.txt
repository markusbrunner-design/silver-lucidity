Do you remember San Francisco
When hippies wore, oh, flowers in their hair?
In that time of peace and love
Gentle people just looking for to share

There was a time in San Francisco
Young people believed the future would be fair
Marched in protest against the war
The Woodstock spirit still lingered in the air

Words of peace were spoken but the dreams were broken,
Lying in ruins, in ruins
The Establishment put down what they saw as rebellion
Leaving just ruins, leaving just ruins

If you go now to San Francisco
Janis Joplin's house is just a tourist sight
In these times of strife and trouble
There are no people to carry on the fight

Let us remember that San Francisco
Where gentle people wore flowers in their hair
