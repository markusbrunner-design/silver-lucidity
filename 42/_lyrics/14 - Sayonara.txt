========================================================

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Will you think of me
When home I'm gone
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
But we can never be together
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever

Cherry blossoms in Kyoto
Fragrants fills the air
The rustle of a silk kimono
Red painted lips and jet-black hair

Porcelain skin
A work of art
Gracefully
The geisha danced
We will always be worlds apart
But I, the traveler
Sat entranced

Sayonara, sakura geisha
My heart almost came undone
In your land of the Rising Sun
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever

Cherry petals began to fall
Between two worlds I was torn
My life's elsewhere
My family calls
But one day
I will return

Sayonara, sakura geisha
Sayonara
Goodbye for ever
