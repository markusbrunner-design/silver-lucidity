========================================================

The rain falls
The rain pours
The rain falls
The rain pours
Forty days and forty nights
Since we've seen daylight

The Ark dips
The Ark rolls
The Ark dips
The Ark rolls
Tossed by black and angry waves
Pray for our salvation
Spare us Lord
Spare us Lord

The rain falls
The rain pours
The rain falls
The rain pours
Forty days and forty nights
Since we've seen daylight

Over the sea the white dove soars
Bearing from the distant shore
The olive branch of peace
The waters, at last, retreat
The mercy rainbow lights the sky
Hope lights the soul of humanity
Hope is the last thing to die
The last thing to die

The clouds part
The sun appears
The clouds part
Hope shines through
Rainbow colors fill the sky
Hopeful is the sunrise

Hope is the last thing to die
