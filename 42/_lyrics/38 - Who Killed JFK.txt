Who killed JFK 
Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I, said the CIA

They were the perfect couple
Admired like movie stars
Waving to the crowds
From their open car

Jack and Jackie
Young and carefree
One November lunchtime
In 1963

Who killed JFK 
Not I, said Lee Harvey
Not I, said Jack Ruby
Not I, said the CIA

Someone knows
But no-one will say

The shot rings out
Loud and clear
The President goes down
Jackie's blood-stained dress
Panic all around

We watched the news
Silent as statues
That November lunchtime
Denying it was true

Who killed JFK
Someone knows

No-one will say
