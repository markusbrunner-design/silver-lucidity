========================================================

100 000 dead
A city laid waste
Hiroshima
Fallout from the atom bomb
Death by cancer for years to come
Hiroshima. Hiroshima

We didn’t want to go to war
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
On that clear August day
In 1945
We were sure we were justified
As I flew to Hiroshima in Enola Gay
We were sure we were justified
As I flew to Hiroshima in Enola Gay

The mushroom cloud blossomed
It shook Enola Gay
Like a piece of flotsam
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done our duty

Winds like a hurricane
Fanned a great firestorm
Left only charred remains
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done our duty

We didn’t want to go to war
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
On that clear August day
In 1945
We were sure we were justified
As I flew to Hiroshima in Enola Gay
We were sure we were justified
As I flew to Hiroshima in Enola Gay
Enola Gay

We didn’t want to go to war
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
They shouldn’t’ve bombed
Pearl Harbor
On that clear August day
In 1945
We were sure we were justified
As I flew to Hiroshima in Enola Gay
We were sure we were justified
