========================================================

A 100.000 dead
A city laid to waste
Hiroshima
Fallout from the atom bomb
Death by cancer for years to come
Hiroshima

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

The mushroom cloud are blossomed
It shook Enola Gay
Like a piece of flotsam
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done
All our duty
Hiroshima

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

Winds like a hurricane
Fanned a great firestorm
Left only charred remains
We were shocked by its deadly beauty
But we all had done our duty
Hiroshima

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
On an August day in (19)45
We were sure that we were justified
Over Hiroshima in Enola Gay

We didn't want to go to war
But then they went, it bombed
Pearl Harbor
