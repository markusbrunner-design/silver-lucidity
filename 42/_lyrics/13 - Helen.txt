========================================================

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Half-goddess, half-human
Throughout her life
Helen's fate was war and strife
The Gods can be cruel
They play with humankind

Aphrodite bribed Paris
To declare her most divine
She promised he could have Helen
To be his wife

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Changed from Greek to Trojan
Helpless, alone
Helen's tears would've melted stone
The Greeks, to avenge her
Set sail across the foam

One hundred thousand men
Into bloody war were thrown
To the death the heroes fought
Never to return home

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Lovely and immortal
Object of men's desire
Helen, Queen of Sparta
Set Greece and Troy on fire
Her face, it is said
Launched a thousand ships
Bloodshed and tears
A war that would last
For ten long years

Knowing they would never
Take Troy by force
The Greeks built a wooden horse
A peace-offering
A promise, oh so false

Soldiers hidden inside
Attacked the city unaware
Massacred the Trojans as they slept
With no remorse
With no remorse

Folly or bravery
Who shall say
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today
But the legend of Helen
Still lives on today
