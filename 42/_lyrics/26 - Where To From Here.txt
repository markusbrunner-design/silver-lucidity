Where are we bound
All bridges burned
Where to from here
Where to

What do we know
So little in fact
Why don't we learn
Don't learn

Today
We stand
In a wasteland
Is there a plan
For this wasteland

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

What can we do
Can we still change the tide
Is there hope left
Hope left

Today
We stand
In a wasteland
Is there a plan
For this wasteland

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

Where to from here
Please let the light appear
Where to from here
What's the answer

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

When the truth is hidden
Hidden
When curiosity is taboo
Tabooo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42
