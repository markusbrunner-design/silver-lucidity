Where are we bound
All the bridges are burned
Where to from here
Where to

What do we know
Very little in fact
Why don’t we learn
Don’t learn

Today we stand
In a wasteland
Wasteland

When the truth is hidden
When curiosity is taboo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

What can we do
Can we still change the tide
Is there hope left
Hope left

Today we stand
In a wasteland
Wasteland

When the truth is hidden
When curiosity is taboo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

Where to from here
Please let the light appear

When the truth is hidden
When curiosity is taboo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

When the truth is hidden
When curiosity is taboo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42

When the truth is hidden
When curiosity is taboo
When questions are forbidden
The answer may as well be 42
