What is existence
Paths that converge then diverge

You love, you live
You take, you give
You laugh, you cry
You try and try
You say hello
Say goodbye also
You believe, then doubt
Wondering what it’s all about

What is existence
Paths that converge then diverge
What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

You flow, you grow
You think you know
You work, you play
You leave, you stay
You feel alone
Talkin’ to your phone
Imagine your lifespan
Wandering on without a plan

What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

Innocence to experience
Impressions, confessions
All in all, it comes down to
The answer is always 42
The answer is always 42

What is existence
Paths that diverge then converge

Innocence to experience
Innocence to experience
Innocence to experience
The paths diverge, then converge
The paths converge then diverge
In each and every existence
