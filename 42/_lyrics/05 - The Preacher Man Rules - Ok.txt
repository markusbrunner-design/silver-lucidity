Intolerance, violence 
Denunciation, accusation 
Imprisonment of the innocent
Nothing new under the sun

Florence in 1494
The Medicis' rule no more
Gone the artists, gone the freedom  
Savonarola's New Jerusalem
The black-robed preacher is grim, austere 
The good people of Florence live in fear 

Thou shalt not dance. Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things 
Thou shalt not paint. Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules. The preacher man rules  
The preacher man rules. The preacher man rules. Ok

Acrid smoke fills the air 
Bonfires of vanities flare 
Vice must be purified by fire 
Infidels must perish on the pyre  
The iron fist in the iron glove  
This man's God is not the God of love 

Thou shalt not dance. Thou shalt not sing
Nor take pleasure in worldly things
Thou shalt not paint. Nor music play
Thou shalt not wander from God's way
Thou shalt the preacher man obey
Cos the preacher man rules. The preacher man rules 
The preacher man rules. The preacher man rules. Ok

Fanatical, ruthless, cold and cruel
Four whole years does Savonarola rule 
But the wheel of fate is about to turn
The preacher man will hang and burn
Hang and burn, hang and burn
Hang and burn
No-one there to mourn
No-one there to mourn
Fanaticism has had its day
Humanism is here to stay

He who chooses to live by the sword 
Dies by the sword, dies by the sword
Preacher man got his just reward
Gone to meet his maker
Be judged by the Lord

Preacher man
No longer rules
Preacher man
No longer rules
Preacher man
No longer rules

No Longer
Rules. Ok
