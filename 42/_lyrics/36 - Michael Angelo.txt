========================================================

Paint drips on my face
My neck aches
My back's done in
4 years of climbing
Up the scaffolding
I've had my fill
Of the Sistine ceiling 

Michael Angelo

Pope said
Hey there, Mike
How'd you like
To paint my chapel
Made me an offer
Told me I would prosper
Could not refuse
Or I'd become a cropper

Michael Angelo

Turned out pretty well
In the end
Despite it all
I'm not a boaster
But in sales of posters
I'm number one
Simply the greatest
