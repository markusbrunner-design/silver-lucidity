========================================================

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas
Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

Thirty pieces of silver in Judas palm  
Pontius Pilate handwashes
Feeling calmed

Jesus, King of the Jews
Is a threat to Rome 
Political disorder
Must be put down 

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Blood money
Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas
Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend

At the foot of the cross the soldiers throw dice
To win Jesus clothes
Well, isn't that nice

Forgive them, Lord
For they know not what they do 
They think I just wanna be King of the Jews

Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas, traitor
Betrayed Messiah
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Judas traitor
Down in hell he rots
Blood money
Judas suicide
Blood money

The wind blows cold on Gethsemane  
In thirty-three AD
Betrayed by Judas
Jesus, condemned
Stands alone without a friend
