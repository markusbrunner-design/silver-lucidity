========================================================

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside
He was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
So good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

This was a war we were not trained for
Tricky bastards them Vietcong
Hiding deep in the jungle
Escaping us through tunnels
Wouldn't come out and fight like a man
So we could bayonet them in hand to hand

But our commanders
They had strategies
Operation Rolling Thunder
Blanket bombing by the ton
Soon they'd have no place to run
Spray Agent Orange herbicide
Who gave a damn if the wildlife died

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside
He was red
And better dead than red
Is what our President said
So good morning, Vietnam
Get ready for Napalm

Biggest military power on the planet
Each soldier a full metal jacket
Can't let the Commies take over Asia
Gotta avoid a red invasion
Whatever the cost
However many lives are lost

They sent us to the killing fields
To fight the yellow man
Cos, on the inside he was red
And better dead than red
