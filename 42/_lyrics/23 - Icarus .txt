========================================================

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Tryin' to escape and be someone
Flyin' high on human pride 
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Spreadin' his wings of feathers and wax
Icarus took flight
Didn't look back
Daedalus cried
Don't go near the sun
I don't want my only son to burn

Eyes wide shut against the sun
Tryin' to escape and be someone
Flyin' high on human pride 
One thing the Gods cannot abide
Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

Icarus soared
Wise words unheeded 
Free as a bird
His hopes exceeded 
The Gods, displeased
Wreaked retribution 
Wings of wax seared by Hyperion

Melting away to a watery death
Icarus drew his final breath
He'd done what none before had dared
Nobody noticed No-one cared

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us

When Icarus took wing and flew
Man's wildest dream came true
Was this courage or sin of pride
Each to his own
Each one decides

Something of Icarus in all of us
Something of Icarus in all of us
