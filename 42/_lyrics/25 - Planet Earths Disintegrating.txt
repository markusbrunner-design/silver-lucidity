========================================================

Animals came in
Two by two
The armadillo
The kangaroo
The lion and the lamb
And the human crew
The Flood destroyed the land
That we knew
But Noah said
We'll make it through
We'll change our way
Peace will come
After the flood

Planet Earth's disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight
We have to choose
And either way we lose

We're on the verge
A new flood
Maybe we didn't
Do so good
Noah's gone
Now it's Elon Musk
Take us to Mars
In him we trust
It's Mars or bust
Who will we chose
Can you pay the price
Can't pay the price
Get left behind

Planet Earth's disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight
We have to choose
And either way we lose

Humanity has lost its bearings
Chaos reigns
Are we past caring
Disruption, corruption
What happened to sharing
Distortion, extortion
Are we past repairing
Me, me, me the push and shove
Iron fist
No velvet glove
The chips are down
The wheel is turning
Nero fiddles on
While the world is burning
It may be absurd
But it's all we deserve
