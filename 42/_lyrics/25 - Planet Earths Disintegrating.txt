========================================================

The animals came in. Two by two
The armadillo, the kangaroo
The lion and the lamb and the human crew
The Flood destroyed the world we knew
But Noah said
We’ll make it through
We’ll change our ways
Change them for good
Peace bird will come
After the flood

Planet Earth’s disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight we have to choose
And either way we lose

We’re on the verge a new flood
Maybe we didn’t do so good
Noah’s gone. Now it’s Elon Musk
Take us to Mars. In him we trust
Like Elon says It’s Mars or bust
Who will be chosen? Those who pay the price
So pay the price. Enjoy the ride
Can’t pay the price? Get left behind

Planet Earth’s disintegrating
The news is devastating
Fight or flight we have to choose
And either way we lose

Humanity has lost its bearings
Chaos reigns. Are we past caring
Disruption, corruption. What happened to sharing
Distortion, extortion. Are we past repairing
Me, me, me the push and shove
Iron fist, no velvet glove
The chips are down. The wheel is turning
Nero fiddles on while the world is burning
It may be absurd
It’s all we deserve
Planet Earth’s disintegrating
It’s all we deserve
