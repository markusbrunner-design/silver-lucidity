========================================================

I - 1:02
Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Pursue the truth
But to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

II - 1:35
Make the road maps
Make the great plans
Try to plot a course
As best you can
Wind-blown, storm-tossed
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

III - 2:08
Pity the humans, looking for meaning
Needing to believe. Dreaming, scheming 
Learning nothing from history
Accept that life is one big mystery 
We’re all like Alice in Wonderland
Can’t even begin to understand

IV - 2:41
No-one controls
Nor time nor tide 
Nor day nor night
Only they decide
Why try to explain
Cos, to any question
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

V - 3:14
Search the heavens
For an answer
Search the seas 
For an anchor
Search for the truth
But, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42

VI - 3:48
Catch 22
Incertitude
No direction
In solitude
Events are random
So, to any question
Whatever you do
The answer’s always 42
The answer’s always 42

SOLO - 4:20

VII - 4:55
Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42

Go with the flow
Accept you don’t know
Just remember 
Whatever you do 
The answer’s always 42
