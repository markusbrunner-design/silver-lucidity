========================================================

The Great War is over
Our boys back from the trenches
And, if you’ll excuse my French
Everybody needs
A bit of Joie de vivre
These are the days 
Of the golden Jazz age

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
Bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

The roaring Twenties are in full swing
Satchmo plays trumpet. Bessie Smith sings
Duke Ellington and his big band play
People dance the Charleston
To the beat of the clave
Down at the Cotton Club the music never stops
Way before Bill Hayley
Rocked around the clock
Everybody’s happy
In Gatsby’s world
In Gatsby’s world

The Temperance League says jazz is immoral
Dissonant, destructive, old fogies quarrel
Daisy says
Oh, let em I guess they’re just jealous
Then pours some more champagne

Drink and make merry
Take a bite at the cherry
Join in the dance and song
After all
What could possibly
What could possibly go wrong

Handsome and rich in 1925
Sure feels good to be alive
Despite the Prohibition Laws
Bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
Just a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world
Life’s a bowl of cherries
Just a bowl of cherries
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

The bootleg liquor flows and flows
We got fast cars. We got fast girls
Life’s a bowl of cherries
In Gatsby’s world

Everybody’s happy in Gatsby’s world
Anything goes in Gatsby’s world
You get what you deserve
