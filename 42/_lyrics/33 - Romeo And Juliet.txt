========================================================

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

On that enchanted night
At the masked ball
It was love at first sight
Romeo couldn't take his eyes
Off Juliet his pure white dove
For Juliet, he was her all in all

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

They listened to their hearts
Loved with their souls
Vowed
They would never be apart
Believing, in their bloom of youth
Love is only the truth
Took each other
To have and to hold

In a violent world
Of hate and war
A family vendetta
Started long before
Two young people
Defied the code
Hand in hand
Chose a different road

Love is stronger than fear
Stronger than pride
Stronger than hate
Stronger even than death
Love is stronger
Love is stronger
Love is stronger
Love is stronger

Romeo and Juliet
Star-crossed lovers
