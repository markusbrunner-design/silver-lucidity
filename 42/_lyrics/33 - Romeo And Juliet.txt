========================================================

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes
Hand in hand chose a different road
In 16th century Verona
Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers

On that enchanted night
At the masked ball
It was love at very first sight
Romeo couldnâ€™t take his eyes off
Juliet his pure white dove
For Juliet, he was her all in all

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes

They listened to their hearts
Loved with their souls
Vowed they would never be apart
Believing, in their bloom of youth
That love is the only truth
Took each other to have and to hold

Love is stronger than fear
Stronger than pride
Stronger than hate
Stronger even than death

In a violent world of hate and war
A family vendetta started long before
Two young people defied the codes
Hand in hand chose a different road
In 16th century Verona
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers
Romeo and Juliet, star-crossed lovers
