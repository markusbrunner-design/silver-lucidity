Black Tuesday

Ch
The American Dream
Play by the rules
Like they taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream got broken by greed
Black Tuesday Stock Market stampede

V1
I worked in the steel mill 
Steady job with decent pay
Everything on credit 
Was the easy way 
Well, they closed the mill down   
Lost my job overnight   
CouldnÕt pay my off my loans 
Then the bank foreclosed
Joined the long breadlines
That was Black Tuesday time

Ch
The American Dream
Play by the rules
Like they taught you at school
And you will gain self-esteem
But the land of milk and honey
Is only focused on money
American dream got broken by greed
Black Tuesday Stock Market stampede

Outro/Bridge
The Great Depression 
But we learned our lesson
ThatÕs what they said
I wouldnÕt wanna betÉ
