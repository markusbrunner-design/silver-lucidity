Something of Icarus Lyrics by Elizabeth Auzan for Silver Lucidity 42Eyes wide shut against the sunTrying to escape and be someoneFlying high on human pride One thing the Gods cannot abideSomething of Icarus in all of usSomething of Icarus in all of usSpreading his wings of feathers and waxIcarus took flight. Didn’t look backDaedalus cried, Don’t go near the sunI don’t want my only son to burnEyes wide shut against the sunTrying to escape and be someoneFlying high on human pride One thing the Gods cannot abideSomething of Icarus in all of usSomething of Icarus in all of usIcarus soared, wise words unheeded Free as a bird. His hopes exceeded The Gods, displeased, wreaked retribution Wings of wax seared by Hyperion.Melting his way to a watery deathIcarus drew his final breath He’d done what none before had dared Nobody noticed No-one cared. Something of Icarus in all of usSomething of Icarus in all of us.When Icarus took wing and flewMan’s wildest dream came trueWas this courage or sin of prideEach to his own. Each one decidesSomething of Icarus in all of usSomething of Icarus in all of us
