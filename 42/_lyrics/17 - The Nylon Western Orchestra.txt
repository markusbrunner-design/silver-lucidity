========================================================

I’m a poor lonesome cowboy
Lost in the modern world
Too much hustle, too much hype
Life was simpler in black and white
Good guy always won the fight
Life was simpler in black and white

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs
The audience could sing along
But now they all are gone
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Still plays on

I’m a poor lonesome cowboy
I miss my Texas Rose
I miss the range and my hometown
Nostalgia’s abringin’ me down
The yellow rose has turned to brown
Nostalgia’s abringin’ me down

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs
The audience could sing along
But now they all are gone
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Still plays on

What happened to the cowboy songs
That simple world. What went wrong
Why do I feel now like I don’t belong
Everything becomes such a big deal
It’s really all quite surreal
All we do is reinvent the wheel

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs
The audience could sing along
But now they all are gone
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Still plays on

The Nylon Western Orchestra
Played all the cowboy songs
The audience could sing along
But now they all are gone
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Plays on and on and on
The Nylon Western Orchestra
Still plays on
