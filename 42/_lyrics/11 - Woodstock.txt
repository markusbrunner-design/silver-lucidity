Get your funk on
Come on, come on
Get your funk on
Come on, come on

Yeah, yeah
We all want a revolution
Just like in Lennon's words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world

We all went up to Woodstock
Funky dudes, long hair, no shoes
Hippies chantin' peace and love
It's the age of Aquarius

Yeah, yeah
We all want a revolution
Just like in Lennon's words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world

Jimi (Hendrix), Joan Baez, Janis Joplin
Folk or funk, the message is clear
Stop the war, the senseless killin'
Politicians, open your ears

Yeah, yeah
We all want a revolution
Just like in Lennon's words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world

Rain poured down but we didn't care
One for all, all for one
It meant so much just to be there
Felt like the battle had been won

Many years have passed
The sky is overcast
The hippies have gone
The new age didn't dawn
But Woodstock is a legend
That still lives on

The guards along the Watchtower
Knew that they'd have a last word
Flowers were no match for power
Like children to be seen not heard

Yeah, yeah
We all want a revolution
Just like in Lennon's words
We had a new solution
That could have changed the world
No more people with minds that hate
We failed
Is it just our fate
Sun sure gonna shine after 1969
Sun sure gonna shine after 1969
Sun sure gonna shine after 1969
