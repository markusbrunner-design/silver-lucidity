Get your funk on
Come on, come on
Get your funk on
Come on, come on

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

We all come on down to Woodstock
Funky dudes. Long hair, no shoes
Hippies chanting Peace and Love
It’s the age of Aquarius

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

Hendrix, Joan Baez, Janis Joplin
Folk or funk, the message is clear
Stop the war, the senseless killing
Politicians, open your ears

We all wanna revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We got new solutions
We gonna change the world
Sun sure gonna shine
After 1969

Rain poured down but we didn’t care
One for all and all for one
It meant so much just to be there
Felt like the battle had been won

Many years have passed
The sky is overcast
The hippies have gone
The new age didn’t dawn
But Woodstock is a legend
That still lives on

The guards along the Watchtower
Knew that they’d have the last word
Flowers were no match for power
Like children to be seen not heard

We wanted a revolution
Just like in Lennon’s words
We had new solutions
That could’ve changed the world
No more people with minds that hate
We failed. Is it just our fate
