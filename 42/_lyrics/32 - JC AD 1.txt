My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule
I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, JC

Mary and Joe, my mum and dad
They kept to themselves  
It was a quiet life we had  

All the time, when I was a child 
Dad said
Be a carpenter
But I was born to be wild

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule
I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, JC

Left home soon as I felt the call 
Started roamin' the country 
Preachin' peace and love to all 

Lots of followers
Lots of likes 
Had fun with my disciples
Turnin' water into wine

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule
I broke free
So now your calendar's AD
Ooh, JC
