My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar’s AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC

Mary and Joe, my mum and dad
They kept themselves to themselves 
It was a quiet life we had 

All the time, when I was a child 
Dad said: Be a carpenter
But I was born to be wild

My name’s Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar’s AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC

Left home soon as I felt the call
Started roaming the country
Preaching peace and love to all

Lots of followers, lots of likes
Had fun with my disciples
Turning water into wine

My name is Jesus Christ 
But they call me JC
Rose to fame in Galilee
Cos from Roman rule I broke free
So now your calendar’s AD
Ooh, ooh, ooh JC
