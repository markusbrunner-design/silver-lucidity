========================================================

Crawling out of the primeval sea
Amphibian creatures learned
To walk and breathe
To shelter in caves
From danger to flee
Are they so different
From you and me

From all fours
To Neanderthal
The cavemen made fire
Fought the dinosaurs
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived
Anonymous lives
Only the strong survived

Genetics, climate change
Sabre-toothed tigers and disease
Brought about the fall
Of this species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

Homo Sapiens
Discovered the wheel
Math and geometry
A great chain of events
But he still destroyed lives
Only the lucky survived
But he still destroyed lives
Only the lucky survived

Genetics, climate change
Constant warfare and disease
Jeopardized the future
Of all species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

Big Brother
Now looks after you
Your life is controlled
You're just a barcode
Anonymous lives
Only the strong will survive
Anonymous lives
Only the strong will survive

Genetics, climate change
Heads buried in sand
Ego and greed
Dark is the future
Of our species

Caveman to Barcode
Plodding along
Evolution's road
Toad to prince
And back to toad
A state of flux
And revolution
Over and over
With no solution

From caveman to barcode
Tribal wars to cyber wars
Can we say that progress has been made
