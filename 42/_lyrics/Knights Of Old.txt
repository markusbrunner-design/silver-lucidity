Intro
Knights of old x 4

V1 0:35
Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing taut the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, fearless and bold

V2 1:04
Returning victorious from war
Searching for a lady to adore
Doing their best to impress
Beautiful damsels in distress.  
Much more difficult for them
Than fighting off 10 000 men

V3 1:30
Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Fighting for country and for King
Drawing taut the longbow string
Wielding the two-edged sword
Daring all to defend their Lord
Knights of old, fearless and bold

Bridge 2:00
My lady, will you dance with me?
I am entranced by your beauty
Iâ€™ll sing your praises on the lute
I swear my love is absolute
My lady, will you dance with me?
I am entranced by your beauty

2:25 Knights of old repeated as in intro







Ch/Outro 2:57
Knights of old, Knights of old
In combat so fearless and bold
Disarmed at the sight of beauty
Bidding farewell to battle and duty
Knights of old, Knights of old
No longer so fearless nor so bold
Knights of old, Knights of old
No longer so fearless nor so bold
