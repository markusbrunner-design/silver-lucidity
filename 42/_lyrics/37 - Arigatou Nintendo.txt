========================================================

Super Mario on my Macintosh
Video game classic, golly gosh
Enter a fantasy world
Where I have several lives
Win a Super Mushroom
And I’ll double in size

God bless Steve Jobs
Arigatou, Nintendo
I’m ten. I’m invincible
I’m Super Mario

Super Mario, life seemed simple then
Sometimes wish I could go back again
To the Mushroom People’s world
Crush Goombas with my fist
Rescue Princess Toadstool
With a flick of the wrist

God bless Steve Jobs
Arigatou, Nintendo
I’m ten. I’m invincible
I’m Super Mario

Super Mario, life seemed
Simpler then
Sometimes wish I could
Go back again
