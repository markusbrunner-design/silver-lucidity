========================================================

Paradise islands, golden sands
Tourists dancing to steel drum bands 
Life seems easy
The rum flows and flows
But under the surface
Something evil grows
Lost Atlantis casting a spell
Under the Paradise is there a hell

Bermuda triangle
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats
Swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry
Or foolish notions

Bermuda triangle
Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats
Swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry
Or foolish notions

Devil's triangle, false or true
Superstitions we can't cut through
Believe it's the Devil if you wish
Believe it's just life so hit and miss
Science can't explain the mystery 
One more enigma of history

Bermuda triangle
