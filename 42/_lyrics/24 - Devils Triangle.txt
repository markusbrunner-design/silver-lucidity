========================================================

Paradise islands, golden sands
Tourists dancing to steel drum bands 
Life seems easy. The rum flows and flows
But under the surface, something evil grows
Lost Atlantis casting a spell
Under the Paradise is there a Hell

Bermuda triangle

Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Paradise islands, golden sands
Paradise Islands. I’m under your spell
How could Paradise turn into Hell

Bermuda triangle

Calm turquoise waters, then angry foam
Whipped into a perfect storm
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions
Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Devil’s triangle, false or true
Superstition we can’t cut through
Believe it’s the Devil if you wish
Believe it’s just life so hit and miss
Science can’t explain the mystery 
One more enigma of history

Bermuda triangle

Calm turquoise waters
Devil hiding in the depths

Planes and boats swallowed by the ocean
Is it devilry or foolish notions

Devilry or foolish notions
