The Y2K Bug, a real
Little thug
From under our feet
Was gonna to pull the rug
Power would shut down
In country and in town
Planes and banks would crash
In a giant whiplash

31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line
For humanity, humanity
01 Jan of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief
We got through it OK
We got through it OK

The Y2K flaw opened
Up the door
To crazy theories
Like never before
Tell all your friends
The world?s gonna end
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive
Log off before midnight
If you want to survive

31st December 1999
Was supposed to be
The end of the line

01 Jan of the year 2K
Brought signs of relief

We got through it OK
We got through it OK

The Y2K glitch made
IT guys twitch
Doomsayers, false prophets
Got filthy rich
But spare a thought

To install upgrades
And beat the fated date

The end of the line
For humanity

The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it OK

The end of the line
For humanity
But we got through it OK

The end of the line
For humanity
Be we got
