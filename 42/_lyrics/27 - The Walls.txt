========================================================

Great Wall of China
No wall finer
Walls they rise
Walls they fall

Walls, Walls, Walls
Walls of Jericho
Walls of Mexico
Walls that are built of
Concrete and steel
Walls built of prejudice
Just as real
Don't build more walls

Great walls of Yalta
Would never falter
Dreams were made
Hopes were raised

Walls, Walls, Walls
Walls of Jericho
Walls of Mexico
Walls that are built of
Concrete and steel
Walls built of prejudice
Just as real
Don't build more walls

New walls in Europe
Are bein' pulled up
Let them shout
Keep them out

One wall
Comes down
In rubble
And dust
Another goes up
A symbol of mistrust
What will it take
For us to learn
From our mistakes
From our mistakes
From our mistakes
From our mistakes
