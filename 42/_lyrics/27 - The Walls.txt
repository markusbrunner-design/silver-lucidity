Great Wall of China
No wall finer
Built forever to last
Yet the enemy passed
Walls they rise
Walls they fall
Don?t build more walls
Don?t build more walls

Woah Uh

Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built
Of concrete and steel
Some walls are
Prejudice just as real

Great wall of Yalta
Would never falter
Iron Curtain came down
Cheered on by the crowds
Dreams were made
Hopes were raised
Where are they now
Where are they now

Woah Uh

Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built
Of concrete and steel
Some walls are
Prejudice just as real

Walls of Jericho. Oh, oh
Walls of Mexico. Oh, oh
Some walls are built
Of concrete and steel
Some walls are
Prejudice just as real

One wall comes down
In rubble and dust
Another goes up
Symbol of mistrust
