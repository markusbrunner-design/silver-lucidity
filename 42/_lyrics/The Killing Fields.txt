The Killing FieldsLyrics by Elizabeth Auzan for Silver Lucidity 42Ch They sent us to the Killing FieldsTo fight the yellow manCos, on the inside he was redAnd better dead than redIs what our President saidGood morning, VietnamGet ready for NapalmV1 This was a war we were not trained for Tricky bastards them Vietcong Hiding deep in the jungle  Escaping us through tunnels Wouldn’t come out and fight like a man So we could bayonet them in hand to hand V2  But our commanders, they had strategies Operation Rolling Thunder  Blanket bombing by the ton  Soon they’d have no place to run Spray Agent Orange herbicide  Who gave a damn if the wildlife died 1:59 Guitar solo with war sound effectsCh They sent us to the Killing FieldsTo fight the yellow manCos, on the inside he was redAnd better dead than redIs what our President saidGood morning, VietnamGet ready for NapalmBridge Biggest military power on the planetEach soldier a full metal jacketCan’t let the Commies take over AsiaGotta avoid a Red invasionWhatever the costHowever many lives are lostOutroThey sent us to the Killing FieldsTo fight the yellow manCos, on the inside he was redAnd better dead than red
