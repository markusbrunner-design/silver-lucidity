========================================================

See the writing on the wall
This message is clear to all
We're numbered
Weighed, divided
There's nowhere
Left to hide 

We're riders on the apocalypse
Nobody's prepared for this
Look at the truth
If you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 
Look at the truth
If you dare 
Better start to say your prayers 
Look at the truth
If you dare

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Now
From Sodom and Gomorrah
Now
To the final Armageddon
No-one has a magic wand
To change this world we've spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

Nero's laughter mocking from the wings
Puppets, dangling from our strings
Waiting for some Noah's Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting for some Noah's Ark
To come save us from the dark
Waiting
God save us

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Now
From Sodom and Gomorrah
Now
To the final Armageddon
No-one has a magic wand
To change this world we've spawned
The bell is about to toll
Pride goes before a fall

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

Did no-one hear the call
We're numbered, weighed, divided
Did no-one hear the call
There's nowhere left to hide

The writing's on the wall
The Bible said it all
The writing's on the wall
The Bible says it all

We didn't heed the call
The bell is about to toll
We didn't heed the call
Pride goes before a fall
