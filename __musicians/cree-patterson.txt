I want to thank you for reading this as it means you have or are listening to our recordings. 
What a joy and a personal outlet for me in being a part of this team. I will give you a little 
background and thoughts for you to pursue a possible dream.

First, I have sung in rock bands for years. Always auditioning in a garage or practice facility, 
where the guitars and drums are so loud you have to scream to sing or at least be heard. You know, 
Bad Co., Led Zep., Aerosmith and so on. It’s what I did because I thought it was the way. Now we 
have internet and home recording equipment that is not terribly expensive. So that brings us up to 
kompoz. Actually a pandemic then kompoz. A website with musicians from all over the world who 
contribute to a composition online.

Stay Healthy

Elizabeth introduced herself to me about 6 months ago. She had written lyrics for a song and had 
heard my voice on another recording. I agreed to sing the lyrics she had written. It was very well 
written with a feel I knew fit the music. We stayed in touch and began to get requests for 
lyric/vocals. Markus introduced himself and had a song with lyric/vocal needs. We completed that 
with a very good response. Markus then told us his ambition to form a group to compose a rock 
opera. A full set of songs around a theme. It was amazing how quickly Elizabeth and Markus grew 
into a music/lyric machine. So many wonderful ideas. Silver Lucidity.

Lastly, sitting in my bedroom downloading music and lyrics to sing to is a dream come true. I can
listen to each musical segment and read the lyric. Then let the melody flow. If it doesn’t work I can 
delete it. If I upload it and either team member doesn’t like it, I can redo it with suggestions. Not 
everything is perfect and it is a process but for me I find it fulfilling. I have no great expectations 
but Markus and Elizabeth are very driven which keeps me going. With the new technologies 
available in recording equipment and the prices reasonable this is the best way I know to hone and 
build your musical skills. So tell your friends and neighbors about Silver Lucidity. And go for your 
dreams.
