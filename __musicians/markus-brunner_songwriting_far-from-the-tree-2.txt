"Far From The Tree" - A Part Of The Herd (Songwriting - Part 2)

After having the melodies for the basic-instrument, it's time for the recording. 

Get to know the bpm!
First of all you have to determine the beats-per-minute (bpm) of the song. If it's not some progressive stuff with time-signature changes you could just use any bpm-measure-tool like a smartphone app to find out the one fitting bpm-speed for your played melody. So install e.g. an app, play the melody and directly afterwards try to get to know the bpm of the played melody. 

DAW
Then you setup your project in a DAW like Steinberg Cubase...

Recording
...and start the recording of the rhythm-instruments on a click or virtual drum-groove.

Guide-Vocals
By using the approach of having already the vocal-melody in mind it's useful to record guide-vocals afterwards or at least to give the vocalist the information of the lyric-slots (verses, choruses...) by providing timestamp-slots.
