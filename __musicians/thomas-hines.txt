Hi, my name is Thomas Hines. I recorded the voice acting part for Professor Jackson in Star-Reaper: "Chapter 11 On Board". I really enjoy voice acting because it allows me the opportunity to become someone far more exciting than I really am in my everyday life. Star Reaper was a great fit for me because I love hanging around on star ships, and for sure one of my huge influences for vocal intonations and character expression is the great William Shatner. Kudos to the cast and crew of the Star Reaper, I enjoyed the ride!
