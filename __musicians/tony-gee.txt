I write music. Looking for collaborators. Genres: Rock/ambient/Heavy/Jazz plus anything interesting.

But - I almost always like 'strange' and 'quirky' music/soundscapes.

Can sing backing vocals but not a strong solo singer.

Play Trumpet, Guitar, Bass and getting to grips with the musical saw [sounds like a theramin] and whatever comes to hand (bones, wine glasses, saucepans, duct tape etc).
