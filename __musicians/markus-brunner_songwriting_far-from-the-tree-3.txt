"Far From The Tree" - A Part Of The Herd (Songwriting - Part 3)

After having the base-instruments and guide-vocals recorded, it's time for replacing the guide-vocals and adding all missing instruments and some "sugar".

Order
In general there is no right or wrong. This really depends on the song or the spirit and creativity of the musicians. The more you've done already - the less you can work with. Means: you can work with only some rhythm-guitars or with everything other in place already. Someone has to start - others join in.

Sync-Tone
For online-collaborations it's a no-go if you provide a song without a sync-tone. "What's that" you may ask! That's a high volume tone sequence before the music starts - so it's prepended before the original song starts. This way the mixer can line-up all instruments independent from the DAW or export-format the others used. Otherwise the music will sound really ugly. Never had a single project on which all music-exports had the same starting-point! This really depends on the DAW and format!

Bedtracks
"What's a bedtrack" => those are files which are exported for instruments to play on. E.g. a "bedtrack drums 102bpm" is a bedtrack which can be used for the drummer. This one has usually no click on it, or at least no drum-groove, but you need the information of the beats-per-minute (bpm). A "bedtrack guitar-lead" would give you e.g. the rhythm-guitars and bass and drums (or demo drum-groove) to play the lead-guitar on-top of the whole song or a special part. So every bedtrack has it's purpose but of course can be used for multiple purposes like e.g. a "bedtrack guitar-lead bass vocals" could be used for several instruments but not the drum-recording.
