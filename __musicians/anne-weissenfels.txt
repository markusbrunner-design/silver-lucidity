I'm a musician with my heart and soul. The sax is my main instrument. 

I'm playing piano for six years and when I feel the need I also sing. When I am not inspired by @silverlucidityband or other musicians, I produce lounge and chillout beats.

I play a Yamaha 62C alto and tenor. The tenor sometimes behaves a bit moody but that is like in every good marriage ;) 

In addition I have a Weltklang baritone sax. My new project is learning the didgeridoo - very cool instrument and I think it's funny and you can come fast into a flow.
