Music has always been my passion - that's the reason why my solo-project is also called "Timeless Passion". 

I play the guitar since my 15th age. I formed a band called "Dark Rain" and we had an awesome time together playing as a starter-band for other cover-bands, because bands with own songs hadn't been that famous like cover-bands in the local areas. The people just wanted to drink and hear songs they already knew. But it was really fun and we recorded a single called "The First Songs" and afterwards our album "Frame of Mind" on which we spent lots of time for recording and mixing. Unfortunately right in the middle of our recordings of the new album "Hope" we quit the band out of several reasons.

Some time later I thought it would be great to do music with musicians around the world. So I searched on the Internet if there's already a portal for that. I stumbled upon kompoz.com and besides some stability problems from time to time this is the most awesome place for musicians with home-recording-setup I know. It's just great to make music with musicians placed all over the planet. But we connect with each other with our passion!

My first fix formation on kompoz.com was a project called "Jäger Volant". On this I play majorly the bass-guitar and add some guitar-layers from time to time. It's sound is more Alternative Metal in the direction of "tool". I want to proceed with that project, too, but since covid-19 our vocalist Matthew is more or less vanished from our view. We hope he gets back soon!

But by having more time for other projects I came to forming this awesome project - and I will never regret it!
