# François Vingrief

La Rochelle, France.

I use a Charvel Limited édition 1991 and a Stratocaster Mexico.
I'm recording with Amplitube 5 and another plugins with Cubase.
I'm playing the guitar, but I'm not a "very good guitarist" because I'm a very lazy man and never worked on my guitar skills. ;-)
