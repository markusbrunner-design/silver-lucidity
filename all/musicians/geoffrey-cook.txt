I have played for 35 years as a session studio performer and have toured with many bands over the years. 

My gift, as many musicians I have worked with have said, is giving a human touch to my recording and injecting raw soul into the song. 

With this album project I have had the privilege of working with some top tier musicians. 

This album collaboration has been a great experience. 

My primary keyboard rig is a Nord Stage 3 for the Hammond B3 sound running through MOTU 828es and Omnisphere and other soft synths to produce my piano and synth sound. I run most of my analog gear through a Bluetube v2 pre.
