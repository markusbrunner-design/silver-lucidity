Some years ago as I heard one of my favourite guitarist Steve Morse say, that he doesn't listen to the releases again after they are released - just by coincidence e.g. on the radio - I first thought "why the hell" - such great songs!

Regarding Songwriting - it's really funny but clear to know that a songwriter listened to his songs so often that the most listeners won't ever beat that (challenge accepted?) - and that before the music is released! ;-)

But as soon as the marketing-phase starts, the next project is already in progress. And there is no real time to focus again on the old songs out of marketing-purposes - the new ones are already in progress. And for a studio musician of course always the work in progress counts for doing the best again!

But regarding you: now have fun with you "STAR REAPER" album! We are very proud of it and hope you all like it!
