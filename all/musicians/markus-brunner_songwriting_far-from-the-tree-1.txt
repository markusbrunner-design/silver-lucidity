"Far From The Tree" - A Part Of The Herd (Songwriting - Part 1)

On this album we do the other way of songwriting. Starting from the finished lyrics I try to put melodies over the lyrics. On this type of songwriting you should already check your melodies with the lyrics and adjust them if needed (or slightly adjust the lyrics as well ;-) ). This is more complicated for the melody-writer, but lets you develop another spectrum of your creativity. So on most of the songs I record the demo vocals with my proposed guide of melody line. They of course can be altered by the vocalist in the end.
