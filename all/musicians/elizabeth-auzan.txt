I love words. I love languages. I coach business people in interpersonal communication - in particular for presentations so I guess fitting words to music to be sung in public was a natural follow-on.
I took a Berklee online course in songwriting, entered contests and sometimes getting to semi-finalist or even finalist.

When I discovered Kompoz it was like finding my tribe!

Thanks to Markus, I’ve collaborated on a whole album which is about to be released. So I’m pretty excited about that and already working on Markus' new album "42" with Cree Patterson again.
Beyond the undeniable musical talents of all the people on this album, there is a bunch of great human beings. Long may we Kompoz together!!

Trying to get ALL the strings to ring clear in e.g. an F chord! 

Meeting people like Markus on the guitar and Cree on vocals helped me realise I had a long way to go before I would be singing my own tunes in public! 

I shall stick to campfire playing - lol. So I guess for the moment, I'll stick to writing lyrics and let the maestros do the rest. 

We make a great team. Listen and you will no doubt agree ;-)
