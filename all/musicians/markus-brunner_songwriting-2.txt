On STAR-REAPER we wrote the plots for each song first. 

Afterwards (in chronological order) I tried to put the correct emotions for the plot into a melody and structure.

On some songs I had a song in mind which I used as a basis for the mood - on others I just used a from-scratch approach. This can restrict you or leave you more creative with the topic. This really depends on your skills. 

Tip: You can improve your skills by playing and composing different music styles over and over again!
