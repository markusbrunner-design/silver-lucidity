In general there are 2 main ways of songwriting. Either you start with the melody and try afterwards to write a fitting lyric or you start with the lyrics or a plot and write a fitting melody for the lyrics/plot.

Which way you use depends on your skills and how you are used to it.

My tips for "melody first":
* listen to a song which mood you want to imitate in the new song and focus on the used elements within - this way you don't write the same songs over and over
* you can use the structure of the imitated song or fit it to your vision

My tips for "lyrics first":
* try to really feel the emotions of the lyrics and write down some notes what you would like in the melody if you had all possibilities
* if you have a melody already try to play it and sing the lyrics to it - you'll probably change something in the melody again
* typical problem: don't forget a solo-section if you like one!
