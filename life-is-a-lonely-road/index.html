[Main Male Protagonist]
Felt like I had no defenses
In a world that made no sense
Meeting you changed my point of view
Gave me hope to start life anew

Life is such a lonely road
Don’t let me travel all alone
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home

You bring me warmth, you bring me light
You share my dreams, help them take flight
You comfort me in times of doubt
You’re the one I can’t do without

Life is such a lonely road
Don’t let me travel all alone
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home

No control over space or time
Living out our puppet lives
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home

Life is such a lonely road
Don’t let me travel all alone
Life is such a lonely road
Don’t let me travel alone

[Main Male Protagonist]
Looking for love on the Internet
Couldn’t believe my eyes
Your profile was perfect
And when we met - no bad surprise
I thanked my lucky stars
We were matched like Venus and Mars

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Disillusion on the Internet
Different photos – same girl
You posted two profiles
I was in shock - end of the world
You were two-timing me
You broke my heart, shattered my dream

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Hiding in Cyberspace
Digital masks for the face
False charms and true lies
Deforming mirrors deceive the mind’s eye
False charms and true lies
False charms and true lies

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

[Main Female Protagonist]
Your profile on the Internet
Really caught my interest
Lots of things to explore
This is what I signed up for

It all went wrong on our first date
You had no car - Turned up late
Took me to some run-down bar
This ain’t what I signed up for

Profile after profile
Night after night
So many losers
on this site
Never gonna find Mr. Right

You got no money, you’re no fun
You always lost, never won
Just can’t take it any more
This ain’t what I signed up for

It can’t work out between us two
It’s over now. I’m through with you
Watch me walk out of the door
You ain’t what I signed up for

Profile after profile
Night after night
So many losers on this site
Never gonna find Mr. Right

Be careful what you sign up for,
Gotta choose better, choose better

[Main Male Protagonist]
I loved that girl
From our first date
I didn't know 
I'd sealed my fate
I trusted her
But I was wrong
I was far too weak
She was far too strong

Why did she break
My lovin' heart?
Why was she fake?
Why did we part?
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

I just can't bear
To be alone
She just don't care
Her heart's of stone
In our old café
My coffee's cold
The sky is all grey
I'm feeling old

Why did she break
My lovin' heart?
Why was she fake?
Why did we part?
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love traps the heart in heavy chains
You swear you won't get caught again
But you know without true love so sweet
Your life will never be complete

Why did she break
My lovin' heart?
Why was she fake?
Why did we part?
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love comes and goes
Why, no one knows
Some doors open
Some doors close
