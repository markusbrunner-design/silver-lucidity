[Narrator]
Damn
Can't sleep again
Well, I'd like to tell a story I suppose
God, are you there

[God]
Yes

[Narrator]
Good
Ah, Place me in the American West, highplanes
Ah, maybe a nice campfire
And a, I don't know, a flute of some type

Well, it's late, so I thought maybe
I would talk to myself a little bit
Families, well, I suppose
we all know how those stories go
This one is about a father
And one of his many sons
An interesting chap
With a bit of a personality problem
Mainly a severe case of both daddy
And anger issues
Not necessarily in that order

And since he was quite a narcissist as well
And thought so highly of himself
When faced with a reality check
Well, you can imagine it was all down hill from there

[Angel]
I fell down to earth
It felt like forever
I fell to the ground
And down on my knees
I fell from so high
No one was my savior
I fell down so hard
And so far from the tree

Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
And far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

Far from the tree
And the heavenly rage
I found up my way
And the key to my cage
The key to my cell
And the key to my shackles
The key to break free
From my anger and hackles

Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
Far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

I was bound to leave
My dorms in the skies
I was bound to live
Couldn't die if I tried
There was no reason
For God's evil deeds
My God never cared
For the meek and their needs

Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
And far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received
Now

[Angel]
When I was born
I was sweet as an angel
I had no worries
Had no doubts
I ruled up the skies
Forever and ever
Lighter than feathers
And faster than light
Faster than light

My father is fierce, yes
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is righteous
My father is holy
My father is good
Daddy cares

When I was home
I never felt sadness
But little I knew
Was waiting up ahead
The times have changed up
And not for the better
And now I'm so far
And so sad

My father is mighty
My father is fearless
My father is heartless
And don't seem to care
How deep I had fallen
How lonely I'm feeling
How dark I've became
And how scared
How dark I've became
And how scared

When I was born
I was free as an angel
I had no worries
Oh, I had no doubts
Nobody told me
Hell, nobody warned me
Reality hurts
Hell, it bites
Hell, it bites
It bites

Now I'm alone
Now I have nothing
Nothing but heartaches
Nothing but pain
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
And now I'm falling again
I'm falling again

My father is fierce
And my father is all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is hiding
My father has vanished
He's not to be found
Anywhere

He's not to be found
Anywhere

[God]
There aren't any stairways to heaven
No ladder could reach to the skies
No soul ever soared
To my garden of Eden
There's no second life when you die
There's no second life when you die

All mythos and stories
All fame and all glory
Are nothing but BS PR
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up my time here
It's better to know who you are

You won't find a stairway to heaven
Or ladder to reach to the sky
No soul ever soared
To my garden of Eden
There's no after life when you die

All mankind might fear you
Then praise you or cheer you
But you better know it's all fake
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up your time here
You better just know what's at stake

You can't buy a stairway to heaven
Or purchase a paradise pass
Your soul will not enter my garden
So better just live
Every day as your last
Every day
Every day
Every day as your last

All mythos and stories
All fame and all glory
Are nothing but BS PR
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up my time here
You better just be who you are

[Angel]
When my dad created summer
I created fall to warn you
Just how dark and cold
Dad's winter's gonna be
And I know that he's your man
Yet I urge you, think again
Is my dad is just the one
That you should fan

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You are comin' from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Since it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

When my dad created winter
I created spring to warn you
Just how hard and hot
Dad's summer's gonna be
And I know in him you trust
Yet I say you surely must
Ask yourselves, is your belief
Is true and just

When my dad created laughter
I created tears to warn you
Just how merciless
And evil dad could be
And I know in him you trust
Yet again you surely must
Understand you have to grow up
And adjust

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You are comin' from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Cause it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

When my dad created living
I created death to show you
Just how ignorant
And heartless dad could be
And I know you wish me gone
But I won't leave you alone
Not before you see how you are
All dead wrong

You have called me many names
You've tormented and you shamed
And I understand just what
You're dreading from
And you have my dad to blame
That all mighty in which name
You have gone to wars and lost
All human form

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You are comin' from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
And it's me that good old God
Kicked out from home

Please don't seek forgiveness path

It's Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through

From Neath the floors

You won't hear me cry for help
You won't hear my plea to darkness

You won't hear my plea to darkness

[God]
I told my son so long ago
There are things you need to know
Love, to laugh, but first of all
Child, you must learn how to fall

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you may fall

Two of them he learned so well
Loving self and jokes to tell
But he never learned at all
How to stumble trip and fall

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you may fall

I have told him many times
Child you must bear in your mind
Sometimes there are falls to take
Learn to fall or you will break

But my child was a stubborn man
To the faulty path he turned
Tries to fly his way to heights
I'm so sad for being right

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you may fall

[Angel]
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

God gave sinners all the best
Leaving me with heaving chest

How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
God created such flawed nest

God made sinners all so blessed
Leaving me as second best

Sins have always made me think
Sins have made me fall and sink
Sinners making me so calm
I am blinded by their charms

Sins have always made me think
Sins have made me fall and sink
Sinners making me so calm
I am blinded by their charms

Why do all believers pass away
Must believers stop to breathe
Death has always made me wonder why
Why do all things die and cease

God unlocked Pandora's box
God is merely one big hoax

God has made me in a blink
God has made me fall and sink
To the deepest hell's abyss
Treating me in such amiss

God has made me in a blink
God has made me fall and sink
To the deepest hell's abyss
Treating me in such amiss

God has made a wrongful sin
God has made me lose and win
Lose my soul and lose my hope
Winning me some sinner's dope

You were never

In my foolish fairytales

Lost or failed

Don't think for a minute
That you're so different

And all of the priests
You might say they're all

Don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for son of mine
But I get why thus they called you
Why these nicks just suit you
Rather fine

I won't sell you
Bedtime stories
Life can never
Have a happy end

And I know your time gets wasted
It's a crime I waste your time
It's a crime I steal your moments
I just want to make you fine

I don't like the dirty nicknames

I came down
To take my toll

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Tick tock tick tock
Mad as hell
Tick tock tick tock
And fully armed

I've been seeking
Not to sink in
Thinking of my
Endless pain
Then I found
A way to kill it
Or at least
To keep restrained

[Narrator]
You can not choose your family
But you can sure damn well try to ignore them

Ok, except on birthdays, and maybe on Christmas
But other than that, you can just stroll
Your way through life
As if they don't even exist

That is, of course, unless God is your father
And by that I mean your "father" father
Not your "heavenly father"
Or some other sort of a religious
Metaphoric way of speaking

Because, if God is really your father
If dad almighty sees and hears everything
Well dude, you're kinda' screwed

Who the hell can really handle being
The adolescent child of the
Righteous Mr. I know it all

What can I say, life's a bitch
One day you're having
The time of your life
Living carefree in daddy's
Luxurious skyscraper penthouse
The next day dad gets pissed at you
Throwing you out on the streets
And leaves you
To rot in hell or someplace else
Of similar godforsaken qualities
Like Jersey for instance

You know
He can be pretty creative
When he wants to be

But why should I do all the talking here
When you can hear it right from the source

[God]
You've travelled far and plunged into
The Sea of Galilee
You've baptized all your deepest thoughts
And washed them all away

You run so long, you run so fast
Run out of breath and air
You run away your irksome past
And truth you couldn't bear

You plunged the Sea of Galilee
Then run the suffering path
You Heard the bells of churches yell
But nothing cracked your crust

The angels tried to get at you
Sent rainy days and frost
I guess they knew since down they flew
What price there was and cost

Your tainted heart has broke you bad
You've mortgaged up your soul
Your childish pride had drove you wild
And made you lose control
Deceits and lies are all you knew
Your morals long been gone
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

You had your share of grief and pain
You went the suffering path
You walked the vale
You've been through hell
But now you're back at last

Your tainted heart has broke you bad
You've mortgaged up your soul
Your childish pride had drove you wild
And made you lose control
Deceits and lies are all you knew
Your morals long been gone
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

Among these walls of stone

[Holy Spirit]
When man is slowly pacing
Facing a well known end
When he begins to near
To ashes dust and sands
When he is takin' one last breath
Inhales one final time
What thoughts are
Passing through his mind
What shivers run down
Through his spine

How painful might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
On his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
When death can't be adjourned
Could a godly kiss bring him a swift
And blessed and calm and carefree end

When man is marching softly
To a well known fate
Could his eternal sleep
Bring ease or will it mitigate
When he's between both heaven's gates
And verge of hell's abyss
Would he engage one final fight
Before he sinks six feet beneath

How painful might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
On his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
When death can't be adjourned
Could a godly kiss bring him a swift
And blessed and calm and carefree end

Before a man descends into the silent ground
Can he remember all the
Songs of seas and sands
Would he at the end be deprived of God's and angels' love
Will he be grounded to despair
Or will his soul soar up above

How painless could these moments be
Before he dies
How fast his soul could soar and fly
How far and high
Would God fulfill his deathbed will
His prayer and last request
Would God grant him
Rest and bliss
And pass him through
His garden's gates

[Angel]
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

God gave sinners all the best
Leaving him with heaving chest

How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
God has put them to the test

God gave sinners every chance
But they seem to be in trance

Sinners always made me sad
Sinners made me raging mad
Sinners making me so spleen
God will end them for their deadly sins

Why won't sinners go away
Why they all just keep to breathe
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to cease

God unlocked Pandora's box
Are we all just godly hoax

God made all in just a blink
Has he never stopped to think
What will his creation mean
Making all these deadly sins

God created sinners too
God created even you
You are evil as can be
So you're not that far from the fatherly tree

[Brother Jesus]
When you feel that life is bruising
Cuts you through and scrapes
When you see you're only loosing
And there's no escape
There's a place that you can go to
Place that keeps you safe
Where the words said
Swirl like potions
Through your heart and brain

And although you're man of mission
Man of aims and goals
Being there sets free your spirit
Helps you break your mold
Kneeling in this place of worship
Clears just who you are
Nude as newborn
Bare and scared as
Lonely fallen star

Clears just who you are
Nude as newborn
Bare and scared as
Lonely fallen star

When you're feeling cold and empty
When you long your home
When as far as the horizon
You see only storms
There's a place that might just help you
To regain your faith
Storms might blow
But you will grow
And become a saint

And although you're no believer
Not a man of god
You can also feel more holy
Whole and less a fraud
Kneeling in this place of worship
Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Northern star

[Holy Spirit]
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No priest or friend
Just him on his own
On his own

To hear the beat
Of heart and nothing else
Nothing else
It's good for one
To find his inner place
Inner space

To find his inner
Inner place
Inner space

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to the wind
And understand
Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
Make the change

Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No God or hope
Just him
On his own
And his wrongs

To hear the beat
Of heart
And understand
Understand
It's good for him
To find his inner place
Promised land

To find his inner
Inner place
Promised land

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to
His heart
And understand
Understand
He's bound to spread
His wisdom
As the sand's
Countless grains

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to

[God]
The light of the night
And daylight is blending
The skies moving slow
Fade to black
And not far away
The trees start to dress green
Winter is gone
Spring is back

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead

The storms that you fear
Are soon to pass over
The wind is relaxing
You see and soon you'll be taking
A path not yet taken
Just take it, so you can fly free
Just do it before
The darkness defeats you
Just fly high
Above all those peaks

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy

Hangs by a thread

The peaks that will front us

[Angel]
When I'm looking back
All I can see is an empty track
One that I've raced with rage
When I was young at heart and age

When I was moving fast
Never looked back at what I have passed
All I cared for was the run
Now I look back and all is gone

When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

I can not cease to think
Funny how all our lies and all our tricks
Master us and mind control
Hold and stick until we fall

When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

If I could hold my peace
If I could keep the world from turning
Could I save all I've missed
If I could
If I could
If I could keep me safe
If I could hold back the flames from burning
Would I save all that I've missed

[God]
You could never
Fly to heaven
Well, and even
If you could
You can't stay
Or even land there
So I don't think
That you should

You will find there
Only strangers
Not the brothers
You have known
You will find you
Don't belong there
You'll be outcast
You'll be stoned

You are not
The Rising Phoenix
You can't burn
Then live again
You're a raindrop
Once you're falling
Down
You are destined
Down the drain
You're a lost raft
You are drifting
Off the shore and out
To sea
You're a lonely tree
You're falling down
To the ground
So silently

[Angel]
I can vividly
Remember
How my life
Has used to be
How I thrived
On guilty pleasures
Now I'm left
With flesh debris

I must be
The Rising Phoenix
I must burn
Then live again
I'm a raindrop
I am falling
Down
To the ground then
Down the drain
I am water
I am drifting
I'm a river run
To sea
I am steaming fumes
I'm soaring up
I'm a cloud again
I'm free

[Angel]
The Rising Phoenix
[God]
You won't burn
[Angel]
And live again
[God]
You're a raindrop
[Angel]
I am falling
Down

You are destined

Down the drain

[Brother Jesus]
You fell down to earth
That felt like forever
You fell to the ground
And down on your knees
You fell from so high
No one was your savior
You fell down so hard
And so far from the tree

[God, Brother Jesus, The Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit (add)]
Far from the tree
Far from your home
Far from your place
And your true airborne form
Far from your crib
Far from your creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

[God]
Far from the tree
And my heavenly rage
You found up your way
And the key to your cage

[Brother Jesus]
The key to your cell
And the key to your shackles
The key to break free
From God's anger and hackles

[God, Brother Jesus, The Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit (add)]
Far from the tree
Far from your home
Far from your place
And your true airborne form
Far from your crib
Far from your creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

[God]
You were bound to leave
Your home in the skies
You felt sorrow and grief
But by now you know why
There's a goddamn good reason
For all I have done
I love you my angel
I love you my son

[Angel]
Far from the tree
And it's poisonous fruits
I sowed all my seeds
And I planted my roots
I thank you dear father
For cutting me loose
For now I can fly
And now I know the truth
