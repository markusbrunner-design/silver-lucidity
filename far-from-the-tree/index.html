When I was born
I was sweet as an angel
I had no worries
I had no doubts
I ruled up the skies
Forever and ever
Lighter than feathers
Faster than light
 
My father is fierce, yes
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is righteous
My father is holy
My father is good
Daddy cares

When I was home
I never felt sadness
But little I knew
What waits up ahead 
The times have changed up
And not for the better
Now I'm so far
And so sad
 
My father is mighty
My father is fearless
My father is heartless
And don't seem to care
How deep I had fallen
How lonely I'm feeling
How dark I've became
And how scared
 
When I was born
I was free as an angel
I had no worries
Oh, I had no doubts
But nobody told me
Hell, nobody warned me
Reality hurts
Hell, it bites
 
Now I'm alone
Now I have nothing
Nothing but heartaches
Nothing but pain
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
And now I am falling
again
 
My father is fierce and
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is hiding
My father has vanished
He's not to be found
Anywhere

When my dad created summer
I created fall to warn you
Just how dark and cold
Dad's winter's going to be
And I know that he's your man
Yet I urge you, think again
Is my dad is just the one
That you should fan

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Since it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

When my dad created winter
I created spring to warn you
Just how hard and hot
Dad's summer's going to be
And I know in him you trust
Yet I say you surely must
Ask yourselves is your belief
Is true and just

When my dad created laughter
I created tears to warn you
Just how merciless
And evil dad could be
And I know in him you trust
Yet again you surely must
Understand you have to grow up
And adjust

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Cause it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

When my dad created living
I created death to show you
Just how ignorant
And heartless dad could be
And I know you wish me gone
But I won't leave you alone
Not before you see how you are
All dead wrong

You have called me many names
You've tormented and you shamed
And I understand just what
You're dreading from
And you have my dad to blame
That all mighty in which name
You have gone to wars and lost
All human form

You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
And it's me that good old God
Kicked out from home

Please don't come here anymore
I have nothing more to give you
Nothing more to give
There's nothing more

Please don't seek forgiveness path
I am parched of absolutions
You've drained me up
Left nothing more

It is Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through
My hallways doors
Charging every step
I dare to take
From Neath the floors

You won't hear me cry for help
You won't hear my plea to darkness
To a go with her
To earth's core

It is Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through
My hallways doors
Charging every step
I dare to take

You won't ever hear me crying
You won't hear my plea to darkness

I've travelled far and plunged into
The Sea of Galilee
I've baptized all my deepest thoughts
And washed them all away

I run so long I run so fast
Run out of breath and air
I run away my irksome past
And truth I couldn't bear

I've plunged the Sea of Galilee
Then run the suffering path
I Heard the bells of churches yell
But none could crack my crust

The angels tried to get at me
Sent rainy days and frost.
I guess they knew since down they flew
what price there was and cost

My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

I had my share of grief and pain
I went the suffering path
I walked the vale I've been through hell
But now I'm back at last

My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Someone who can blend
A part of the herd

It's not easy to be
A stranger like me
To make myself smile
All that while I feel vile

It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside me
I'm freaked
All that while
This is not easy
I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea how can I carry on
for long

I wish not to care
How everyone stare
How everyone dare
Is anyone there
Does anyone care
How I'm scared

It's not easy to be

To make myself smile

And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun
You just loved to hear
What everybody said

And you didn't understand
When you dreamed of fame and such
That the Spotlights like the sun
Will burn so much

And when everybody said
Keep your distance watch ahead
And Be carful not to fly
Up high to fast

You were quick to learn and grasp
But you soared up anyway
Leaving all the rest with nothing
but star's dust

If you fly
Much too high
You'll fall free
To the sea

And when everybody claimed
Pay the price that comes with fame
And the hounds of press just pressed with no restraints
they all wanted dirt and juice
Never gave you day of truce
Never left a single page without your name
Your shame

And when everybody stalked
Then they found you, rubbed and poked
All your scars and wounds
And all your bleeding cuts

And they left you hurt and scared
Just because they thought you're dead
And to stay like that
Was probably more smart

And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun
They all chased you
Like they all were madly crazed

And there're some that won't keep still
They'll besiege, until you'll kneel
They all worship you
But don't care how you feel

They will never let you down
Once they crashed you to the ground
And they never go away
And let you heal

So keep flying little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
The precious time you have

So fly high, my little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
The precious time you have

Song VII ? Hugs and Kisses

Verse I
I guess we all have learned by now
Well scratch that it's no guess
Our world was born in ancient sin
And since it's been a mess

Chorus
Don't settle for
A hug and kiss
My father used to say
It might feel good
But surely would
End up in breaking bad

Verse II
Don't settle son for laughs and fun
My father used to say
It might feel nice to role the dice
Unless it's not your day

Bridge
No single saint is to be found
No one to stand the test
No lifeboat to assail to shore
There is no safety net

Chorus
Don't let no one deceit your heart
And break it into shards
Don't let them touch
And know this much
No one will be your guard


Song VIII ? Soundproofed

Verse I
I need to build a wall
A soundproofed barrier
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

Chorus
A wall will keep me safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
My over flooded mind

Verse II
I need someone to guard
To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

Chorus
A wall will keep me safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
My over flooded mind

Verse III
I need to find someone
I need to have a friend
To help me slay and kill
The beasts inside my head

Ending Verse
I have to build a wall
So I can keep my sane
A wall to stop the sounds
And agonizing pain


Song IX ? Anger Issues

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
and fully armed

Verse I
No one ever
Cared for me
Let me off
Or let me be
I was like
A walking bomb
with a detonator
Armed

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
And meaning harm

Verse II
without proper
Caring hold
All bombs destined
to explode
But I didn't
Lose control
I came down
To take my toll

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
and fully armed

Verse III
I've been seeking
Not to sink in
Thinking of my
Endless pain
Then I found
A way to kill it
Or at least
To keep restrained

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Better walk
Better yet
You better run

Song X ? Songs of Seas and Sands

Verse I

When man is slowly pacing
facing well known end
When he begins to near
to ashes dust and sands
When he is taking one last breath
Inhales one final time
What thoughts are
passing through his mind
What shivers run down
through his spine

Chorus

How painful Might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
on his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
when death can't be adjourned
Could godly kiss bring him a swift
and blessed and calm and carefree
end

Verse II

When man is marching softly
to a well known fate
Could his eternal sleep
bring ease or mitigate
When he's between both heaven's gates
and verge of hell's abyss
Would he engage one final fight
before he sinks six feet
Beneath

Chorus

How painful Might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
on his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
when death can't be adjourned
Could godly kiss bring him a swift
and blessed and calm and carefree
end

Bridge
Before a man descends into the silent ground
Can he remember all the
Songs of seas and sands
Would at the end he'll be deprived of God's and angels' love
Will he be grounded to despair
Or will his soul soar up
Above

Chorus
How painless could these moments be
Before he dies
How fast his soul could soar and fly
how far and high
Would God fulfill man's deathbed will
Man's prayer and last request
Would God might grant him
rest and bliss
and pass him through
his garden's gates


Song XI - How to fall

Verse I
Father told me long ago
There are things you need to know
Craft, to laugh, but first of all
Child, you must learn how to fall

Chorus
Child, you see, my father said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall

Verse II
Two of them I learned so well
Working hard and jokes to tell
But I never learned at all
How to stumble trip and fall

Chorus
Child, you see, my father said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall

Verse III
Father told me many times
Child you must bear in your mind
Sometimes there are falls to take
Learn to fall or you will break

Chorus
Child, you see, my father said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall

Chorus
Father was a wise old man
Many things he taught I've learned
But I walked my way to heights
Fathers aren't always right


Song XII - Heartbreak trail

Verse I
One of these days
I'll reach the skies
A day will come I Shall break free
And I'll escape my life of lies

Pre Chorus I
For far too long
I've been so scared
For far too long
I lived in fears
But time on earth is much too short
and every moment is so dear

Chorus I
So I must take
The heartbreak trail
And I must learn from each mistake
And I must thrive on every fail
And I must leave
My past behind
And I must spring
From every fall
And I must face the storms ahead
And I must try and never stall

Verse II
The trail I'll take
Is long and rough
But far to long I've sat so still
For far too long I've been in cuffs

Pre Chorus II
For far too long
I lived in fears
But now I know
At least this much
For far too long I?ve been unheard
Because I feared to take a punch

Chorus II
So I must take
The heartbreak trail
And I must learn from each mistake
And I must thrive on every fail
And I must leave
My past behind
And I must spring
From every fall
And I must face the storms ahead
And I must try and never stall

Bridge
But now I think
No, Now I'm sure
That every strike and every blow
Will help me rise and fly and soar

Chorus III
So I must take
The heartbreak trail
And I must learn from each mistake
And I must thrive on every fail
And I must leave
My past behind
And I must spring
From every fall
And I must face the storms ahead
And I must try and never stall

Chorus IV
So I must take
The heartbreak trail
And I must learn from each mistake
And I must thrive on every fail
And I must leave
My past behind
And I must spring
From every fall
And I must face the storms ahead
And I must try and never stall

Song XIII - Before The Edge

Verse I
When I am looking back
All I can see is an empty track
One that I've raced with rage
When I was young at heart and age

Verse II
When I was moving fast
Never looked back at what I've passed
Thinking just of the run
Now I look back and all is gone

Pre Chorus
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and scatty

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I will never be young again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Verse III
I Cannot cease to think
Funny how all our lies and tricks
Master us and mind controlling
Hold and stick until we're falling


Pre Chorus
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and scatty

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I will never be young again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Bridge
If I could hold my peace
If I could keep the world from turning
Could I save all I've missed
From the surrounding flames
That burns me
Solo

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I will never be young again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Song XIV ? Fly

Verse I
The light of the moon and daylight are blending
The skies move so slow fade to black
And not far away the nature's awaking
Winter is gone, Spring is back

Chorus
The choices we make are not easy
Damocles' sword hangs by thread
The peaks that will front us are chilly
But there're Sunny days up ahead

Verse II
The storms coming are sure to pass over
The wind is relaxing I see
and soon I'll be taking a path not yet taken
I'll take it so I can fly free
I'll do it before the end comes upon me
Just fly up above all those peaks

Chorus
The choices we make are not easy
Damocles' sword hangs by thread
The peaks that will front me are chilly
But there're sunny days up ahead
