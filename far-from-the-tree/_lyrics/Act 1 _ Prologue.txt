(spoken by "Narrator" & "God")

[Narrator]
Damn
Can't sleep again
Well, I'd like to tell a story I suppose
God, are you there

[God]
Yes

[Narrator]
Good
Place me in the American West, highplanes
Ah, maybe a nice campfire
And a, I don't know, a flute of some type

Well, it's late, so I thought maybe 
I would talk to myself a little bit
Families, well, I suppose 
we all know how those stories go
This one is about a father 
And one of his many sons
An interesting chap
With a bit of a personality problem
Mainly a severe case of both daddy 
And anger issues
Not necessarily in that order

And since he was quite a narcissist as well 
And thought so highly of himself
When faced with a reality check
Well you can imagine it was all down hill from there
