[God]
There aren't any stairways to heaven
No ladder could reach to the skies
No soul ever soared
To my garden of Eden
There's no second life when you die
There's no second life when you die

All mythos and stories
All fame and all glory
Are nothing but BS PR
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up my time here
It's better to know who you are

You won't find a stairway to heaven
Or ladder to reach to the sky
No soul ever soared
To my garden of Eden
There's no after life when you die

All mankind might fear you
Then praise you or cheer you
But you better know it's all fake
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up your time here
You better just know what's at stake

You can't buy a stairway to heaven
Or purchase a paradise pass
Your soul will not enter my garden
So better just live
Every day as your last
Every day
Every day
Every day as your last

All mythos and stories
All fame and all glory
Are nothing but BS PR
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up my time here
You better just be who you are

All mythos and stories
All fame and all glory
Are nothing but BS PR
I'm telling you son dear
Don't waste up my time here
You better just be who you are
