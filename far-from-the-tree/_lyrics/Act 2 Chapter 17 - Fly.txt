[God]
The light of the night
And daylight is blending
The skies moving slow
Fade to black
And not far away
The trees start to dress green
Winter is gone
Spring is back

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly  
But there are blooming trees up ahead

The storms that you fear
Are soon to pass over
The wind is relaxing
You see and soon you'll be taking
A path not yet taken
Just take it, so you can fly free
Just do it before
The darkness defeats you
Just fly high
Above all those peaks

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead

The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
But there are blooming trees up ahead
