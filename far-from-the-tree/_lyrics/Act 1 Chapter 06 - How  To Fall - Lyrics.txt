Verse I - 0:14.4
I told me son so long ago
There are things you need to know
Love, to laugh, but first of all
Child, you must learn how to fall

Chorus - 1:09.3
"Child, you see", that's what I said
"You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall"   

Verse II - 1:46.1
Two of them he learned so well
Loving self and jokes to tell
But he never learned at all
How to stumble trip and fall

Chorus - 2:39.2
"Child, you see", that's what I said
"You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall"
       
Verse III - 3:16.1
I have told him many times
Child you must bear in your mind
Sometimes there are falls to take
Learn to fall or you will break

Bridge - 3:51.9
But my child was stubborn man
To the faulty path he turned
Tries to fly his way to heights
I'm so sad for being right

Chorus - 3:18.6
"Child, you see", that's what I said
"You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
that's how hard, child, you might fall"
