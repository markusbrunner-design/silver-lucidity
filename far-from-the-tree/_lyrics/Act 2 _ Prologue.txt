========================================================

You can not choose your family, but you can sure damn well try to ignore them. 

Ok, except on birthdays, and maybe on Christmas, but other than that, 
you can just stroll your way through life as if they don't even exist.

That is, of course, unless God is your father, and by that I mean your "father" father, 
not your "heavenly father" or some other sort of a religious metaphoric way of speaking.

Because, if God is really your father. If dad almighty sees and hears everything? 
Well dude, you're kinda' screwed.

Who the hell can really handle being the adolescent child of the righteous Mr. I know it all?

What can I say, life's a bitch. One day you're havin' the time of your life, 
living carefree in daddy's luxurious skyscraper penthouse; 
the next day dad gets pissed at you, throwing you out on the streets and leaves you 
to rot in hell or someplace else of similar godforsaken qualities, like Jersey for instance.

You know: he can be pretty creative when he wants to be! 

But why should I do all the talking here when you can hear it right from the source?
