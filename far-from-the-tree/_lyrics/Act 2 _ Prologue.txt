[Narrator]
You can not choose your family
But you can sure damn well try to ignore them

Ok, except on birthdays, and maybe on Christmas
But other than that, you can just stroll
Your way through life
As if they don't even exist

That is, of course, unless God is your father
And by that I mean your "father" father
Not your "heavenly father"
Or some other sort of a religious
Metaphoric way of speaking

Because, if God is really your father
If dad almighty sees and hears everything
Well dude, you're kinda' screwed

Who the hell can really handle being
The adolescent child of the
Righteous Mr. I know it all

What can I say, life's a bitch
One day you're having
The time of your life
Living carefree in daddy's
Luxurious skyscraper penthouse
The next day dad gets pissed at you
Throwing you out on the streets
And leaves you
To rot in hell or someplace else
Of similar godforsaken qualities
Like Jersey for instance

You know
He can be pretty creative
When he wants to be

But why should I do all the talking here
When you can hear it right from the source
