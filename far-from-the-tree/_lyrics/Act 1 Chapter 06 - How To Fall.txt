[God]
I told my son so long ago
There are things you need to know
Love, to laugh, but first of all
Child, you must learn how to fall

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you may fall

Two of them he learned so well
Loving self and jokes to tell
But he never learned at all
How to stumble trip and fall

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you might fall

I have told him many times
Child you must bear in your mind
Sometimes there are falls to take
Learn to fall or you will break

But my child was a stubborn man
To the faulty path he turned
Tries to fly his way to heights
I'm so sad for being right

Child, you see, that's what I said
You can climb high to no end
Just as high you'll set your goal
That's how hard, child, you might fall
