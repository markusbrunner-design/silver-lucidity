[God]
You were never
A strong believer
In my foolish fairytales
Tales of wondrous
High achievers
Men of god who never
Lost or failed

Don't think for a minute
That you're so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they're all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

Don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for son of mine
But I get why thus they called you
Why these nicks just suit you
Rather fine

Don't think for a minute
That you're so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they're all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

I won't say that
I'm not worried
I won't say
I'm not afraid
I won't sell you
Bedtime stories
Life can never
Have a happy end

And I know your time gets wasted
It's a crime I waste your time
It's a crime I steal your moments
I just want to make you fine

I don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for son of mine
But I get why thus they called you
Why these nicks just suit you
Rather fine

Don't think for a minute
That you're so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they're all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist
