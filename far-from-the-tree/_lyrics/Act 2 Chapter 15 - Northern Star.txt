[Brother Jesus]
When you feel that life is bruising
Cuts you through and scrapes
When you see you're only loosing
And there's no escape
There's a place that you can go to 
Place that keeps you safe
Where the words said
Swirl like potions
Through your heart and brain

And although you're man of mission
Man of aims and goals
Being there sets free your spirit
Helps you break your mold
Kneeling in this place of worship
Clears just who you are
Nude as newborn
Bare and scared as
Lonely fallen star

Clears just who you are
Nude as newborn
Bare and scared as
Lonely fallen star

When you're feeling cold and empty
When you long your home
When as far as the horizon
You see only storms
There's a place that might just help you
To regain your faith
Storms might blow
But you will grow
And become a saint

And although you're no believer
Not a man of god
You can also feel more holy 
Whole and less a fraud
Kneeling in this place of worship
Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Clears up who you are
Nude as newborn
Bright and Shiny
As the northern star

Northern star
