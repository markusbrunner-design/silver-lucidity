(sung by Brother Jesus)

Verse I - 0:23
And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun
You just loved to hear
What everybody said
And you didn't understand
When you dreamed of fame and such
That the Spotlight's like the sun
Will burn so much

Verse II - 0:47
And when everybody said 
Keep your distance watch ahead
And be carful not to fly
Up high to fast
You were quick to learn and grasp
But you soared up anyway
Leaving all the rest with nothing
But star's dust
  
Transition - 1:24
If you fly 
Much too high
You'll fall free 
To the sea

Verse III - 1:55
And when everybody claimed
Pay the price that comes with fame
And the hounds of press just pressed
With no restraints
They all wanted dirt and juice
Never gave you day of truce
Never left a single page
Without your name
Your shame

Verse IV - 2:33
And when everybody stalked
Then they found you, rubbed and poked
All your scars and wounds
And all your bleeding cuts
And they left you hurt and scared
Just because they thought you're dead
And to stay like that
Was probably more smart

Verse V - 3:11
And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun            
They all chased you like they all 
Were madly crazed
And there were some that won't keep still
They'll besiege, until you'll kneel
They'll all worship you
But don't care how you feel

Bridge - 3:48
They will never
Let you down
Once they crashed
You to the ground
And they never
Go away  
And let
You heal

Chorus I - 4:26
So keep flying little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Chorus II - 4:45
Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
the precious time you have

Chorus III - 5:03
So fly high, my little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Chorus IV - 5:21
Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
The precious time you have
