(sung by the Angel)

Verse I - 0:21.5
When I am looking back
All I can see is an empty track
One that I've raced with rage
When I was young at heart and age

Verse II - 0:48.5
When I was moving fast
Never looked back at what I've passed
All I cared for was the run
Now I look back and all is gone

Pre-Chorus I - 1:15.5
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

Chorus I - 1:42
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Verse III - 2:23.5
I can not cease to think
Funny how all our lies and tricks
Master us and mind control
Hold and stick until we fall

Pre-Chorus II - 2:51
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

Chorus II - 3:17
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Bridge - 3:46
If I could hold my peace
If I could keep the world from turning
Could I save all I've missed
If I could keep me safe
If I could hold back the flames from burning
Would I save all I've missed

[Solo] - 4:11 - 4:38

[Transition (Drums)] - 4:38 - 4:46

Chorus III - 4:46
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must stop before the edge
