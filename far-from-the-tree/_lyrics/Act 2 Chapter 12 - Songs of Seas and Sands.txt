[Holy Spirit]
When man is slowly pacing
Facing a well known end
When he begins to near
To ashes dust and sands
When he is takin' one last breath
Inhales one final time
What thoughts are
Passing through his mind
What shivers run down
Through his spine

How painful might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
On his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
When death can't be adjourned
Could a godly kiss bring him a swift
And blessed and calm and carefree end

When man is marching softly
To a well known fate
Could his eternal sleep
Bring ease or will it mitigate
When he's between both heaven's gates
And verge of hell's abyss
Would he engage one final fight
Before he sinks six feet beneath

How painful might these moments be
Before he dies
What sorrow and what grief he'll feel
On his demise
Could good old God be kind to him
When death can't be adjourned
Could a godly kiss bring him a swift
And blessed and calm and carefree end

Before a man descends into the silent ground
Can he remember all the
Songs of seas and sands
Would he at the end be deprived of God's and angels' love
Will he be grounded to despair
Or will his soul soar up above

How painless could these moments be
Before he dies
How fast his soul could soar and fly
How far and high
Would God fulfill his deathbed will
His prayer and last request
Would God grant him
Rest and bliss
And pass him through
His garden's gates
