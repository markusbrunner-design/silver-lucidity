Far From The Tree - Chapter xx: A Part Of The Herd (Revised) (Sung by God)

[The same melody as "A part of the herd" - That is sung by "The Angel" with the original lyrics]

Verse I - 0:14
I wish you were here
I wish you could near
Everyone else
Both seen and both heard
Someone who won't bend
And lead up my herd

Pre Chorus - 0:32
It's not easy to be
A stranger like thee
To make yourself smile
All that while you feel vile

Chorus - 0:48
It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside you are freaked
All that while
This is not easy
I see how you're freezing
I have no idea how can you carry on
for long

Verse II - 1:12
I wish not to care
How everyone stare
How everyone dare
But know that I'm there
Just know that I care
Don't be scared

Pre Chorus - 1:33
It's not easy to be
A stranger like thee
To make yourself smile
All that while
You feel vile

Chorus - 1:45     
It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside you
Are freaked
out and die
This is not easy
I see you are freezing
I have no idea
How can you
Carry on
For long
For long

Solo - 2:19

Outro - 2:41
I wish
You won't fear
I wish you could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd
