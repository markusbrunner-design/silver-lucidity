(sung by the Angel & God)

[Angel]
Verse I - 0:25
I need to build a wall
A soundproofed barrier 
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

[God]
Chorus - 0:52
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind

[Angel]
Verse II - 1:20
I need someone to guard
To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

[God]
Chorus - 1:47
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
My mind

[Angel]
Verse III - 2:15
I need to find someone
I need to have a friend
To help me slay and kill
The beasts inside my head 

[God]
Verse VI - 2:39
You have to build a wall
So you can keep your sane
A wall to stop the sounds
And agonizing pain

[God]
Chorus - 3:07
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
Mind
Mind

A soundproofed barrier 
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

[God]

A wall will keep me safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
My over flooded mind
Mind
