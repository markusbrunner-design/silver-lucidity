Verse I & II - 0:37.5
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
2> Be alone
No priest or friend
Just him on his own
2> On his own

To hear the beat
Of heart and nothing else
2> Nothing else
It's good for one
To find his inner place
2> Inner space

To find his inner place
2> Inner space

Chorus - 1:42
It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
2> All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
2> On his mind
To listen to
The wind and understand
2> Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
2> Make the change

Verse III & IV - 2:31.5
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
2> Be alone
No God  or hope
Just him on his own
2> And his wrongs

To hear the beat
Of heart and understand
2> Understand
It's good for him
To find his inner place
2> Promised land

To find his inner place
2> Promised land

Chorus - 4:00.5
It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
2> All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
2> On his mind
To listen to
His heart and understand
2> Understand
He's bound to spread
His wisdom as the sand's
1&2> Countless grains

SOLO - 4:50

Chorus 5:51.5
It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
2> All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
2> On his mind
To listen to
The wind and understand
2> Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
1&2> Make the change
