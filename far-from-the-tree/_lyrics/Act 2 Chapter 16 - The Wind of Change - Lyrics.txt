Verse I
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No priest or friend
Just him on his own
On his own

Verse
To hear the beat
Of heart and nothing else
Nothing else
It's good for one
To find his inner place
Inner space

Chorus
It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
To listen to
The wind and understand
Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
Make the change

Verse III
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No God or hope
Just him on his own
And his wrongs

Verse IV
To hear the beat?
Of heart and understand
Understand
It's good for him
To find his inner place
Promised land

Chorus
It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
To listen to
His heart and understand
Understand
He's bound to spread
His wisdom as the sand's
Countless grains
