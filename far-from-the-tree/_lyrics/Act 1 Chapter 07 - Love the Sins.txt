(sung by the Angel)

Verse I - 0:14.5
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

Pre-Chorus I - 0:51
God gave sinners all the best
Leaving me with heaving chest

Verse II - 1:10.5
How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
God created such flawed nest

Pre-Chorus II - 1:47
God made sinners all so blessed
Leaving me as second best

Chorus I - 2:06
Sins have always made me think
Sins have made me fall and sink
Sinners making me so calm
I am blinded by their charms

[Solo] - 2:33.5

Bridge - 3:11
Why do all believers pass away
Must believers stop to breathe
Death has always made me wonder why
Why do all things die and cease

Pre-Chorus III - 3:48
God unlocked Pandora's box
God is merely one big hoax

Chorus II - 4:07
God has made me in a blink
God has made me fall and sink
To the deepest hell's abyss
Treating me in such amiss

[2/4 break] - 4:35

Chorus III - 4:36
God has made a wrongful sin
God has made me lose and win
Lose my soul and lose my hope
Winning me some sinner's dope
