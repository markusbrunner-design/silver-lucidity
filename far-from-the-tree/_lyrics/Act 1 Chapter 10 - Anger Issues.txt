[Angel]
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Tick tock tick tock
Mad as hell
Tick tock tick tock
And fully armed

No one ever
Cared for me
Let me off
Or let me be
I was like
A walking bomb
With a detonator
Armed

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Tick tock tick tock
Mad as hell
Tick tock tick tock
And meaning harm

Without proper
Caring hold
All bombs destined
To explode
But I didn't
Lose control
I came down
To take my toll

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Tick tock tick tock
Mad as hell
Tick tock tick tock
And fully armed

I've been seeking
Not to sink in
Thinking of my
Endless pain
Then I found
A way to kill it
Or at least
To keep restrained

Tick tock tick tock
