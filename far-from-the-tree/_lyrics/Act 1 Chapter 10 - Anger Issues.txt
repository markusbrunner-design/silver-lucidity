(sung by the Angel)

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
And fully armed

No one ever
Cared for me
Let me off
Or let me be
I was like
A walking bomb
With a detonator
Armed

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
And meaning harm

Without proper
Caring hold
All bombs destined
To explode
But I didn't
Lose control
I came down
To take my toll

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
And fully armed

I've been seeking
Not to sink in
Thinking of my
Endless pain
Then I found
A way to kill it
Or at least
To keep restrained

Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Better walk
Better yet
You better run
