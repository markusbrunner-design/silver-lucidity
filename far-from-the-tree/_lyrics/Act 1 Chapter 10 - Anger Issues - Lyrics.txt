Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
and fully armed

Verse I
No one ever
Cared for me
Let me off
Or let me be
I was like
A walking bomb
with a detonator
Armed

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
And meaning harm

Verse II
without proper
Caring hold
All bombs destined
to explode
But I didn't
Lose control
I came down
To take my toll

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Round the block
Mad as hell
and fully armed

Verse III
I've been seeking
Not to sink in
Thinking of my
Endless pain
Then I found
A way to kill it
Or at least
To keep restrained

Chorus
Tick tock tick tock
Take a walk
Tick tock tick tock
Here I come
Tick tock tick tock
Better walk
Better yet
You better run
