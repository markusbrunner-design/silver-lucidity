Verse I
When I am looking back
All I can see is an empty track
One that I've raced with rage
When I was young at heart and age

Verse II
When I was moving fast
Never looked back at what I've passed
All I cared for was the run
Now I look back and all is gone

Pre Chorus
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Verse III
I Cannot cease to think
Funny how all our lies and tricks
Master us and mind controlling
Hold and stick until we're falling

Pre Chorus
When I was young I was trigger happy
Battles and cannons couldn't threat me
How I believed that none could hurt me
How could I've been so dumb and carefree

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must slow before the edge

Bridge
If I could hold my peace
If I could keep the world from turning
Could I save all I've missed
From the surrounding flames
That burns me

Solo

Chorus
The walls of Jericho keep on falling
Stone after stone just keeps on rolling
Smashing and crushing hard around me
Now I just run to flee the steep scree
I know that there is no return
That I can never go back again
I know that there is a cliff ahead
So I must stop before the edge
