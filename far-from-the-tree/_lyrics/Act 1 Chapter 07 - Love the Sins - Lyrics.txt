Verse I
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

Pre Chorus
God gave sinners all the best
Leaving me with heaving chest

Verse II
How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
God created such flawed nest

Pre chorus
God made sinners all so blessed
Leaving me as second best

Chorus
Sins have always made me think
Sins have made me fall and sink
Sinners making me so calm
I am blinded by their charms

[Solo]

Bridge
Why do all believers pass away
Must believers stop to breathe
Death has always made me wonder why
Why do all things die and cease

Pre Chorus
God unlocked Pandora's box
God is merely one big hoax

Chorus
God has made me in a blink
God has made me fall and sink
To the deepest hell's abyss
Treating me in such amiss

Chorus
God has made a wrongful sin
God has made me lose and win
Lose my soul and lose my hope
Winning me some sinner's dope
