(sung by the Angel)

Kapodaster 3rd fret => written Am = Cm

Verse I - 0:09 (Am Em C G Am Em C C)
I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Someone who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

Pre Chorus - 0:35 (Am Em G C Em7 Am Em C)
It's not easy to be
A stranger like me 
To make myself smile
All that while I feel vile

Chorus - 0:52 (Dm C Am Em Dm C Em7 Em7 Dm C Em7 Em7)
It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside me
I'm freaked
All that while
This is not easy
I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea how can I carry on
for long

Verse II - 1:20 (Am Em C G Am Em C C)
I wish not to care
How everyone stare
How everyone dare
Is anyone there
Does anyone care
How I'm scared

Pre Chorus - 1:39 (Am Em G C Am Em C)
It's not easy to be
A stranger like me
To make myself smile
All that while  
I feel vile

Chorus 1:55 (Dm C Am Em Dm C Em7 Em7 Dm C Em7 Em7)
It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside me
I'm freaked
out and die
This is not easy
I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea
How can I
carry on
For long

Solo - 2:22 (Dm Am C Em Dm Am C C Dm Am C Em Dm Am C Em)

Outro - 2:42 (Am Em C G Am Em C C) repeat till end
I wish
Not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd
