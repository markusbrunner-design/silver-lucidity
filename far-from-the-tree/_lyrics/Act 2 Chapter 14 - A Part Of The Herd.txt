[Angel]
I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Someone who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

It's not easy to be
A stranger like me 
To make myself smile
All that while, I feel vile
I feel vile

It's not easy to keep on
Laughing when deep
Inside me I'm freaked all that while
It's not easy, I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea
How can I carry on, for long

I wish not to care
How everyone stare
How everyone dare
Is anyone there
Does anyone care
How I am scared

It's not easy to be
A stranger like me
To make myself smile
All that while, I feel vile
I feel vile

It's not easy to keep on
Laughing when deep
Inside me I'm freaked out and die
It's not easy, I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea
How can I carry on, for long

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd

I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
A part of the herd
