[God]
Please don't come here anymore
I have nothing more to give you
Nothing more to give
There's nothing more

Please don't seek forgiveness path
I am parched of absolutions
You've drained me up
Left nothing more

It's Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through
My hallways doors
Charging every step
I dare to take
From Neath the floors
I dare to take
From Neath the floors

You won't hear me cry for help
You won't hear my plea to darkness
To a go with her
To earth's core

It's Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through
My hallways doors
Charging every step
I dare to take
From Neath the floors
I dare to take
From Neath the floors

You won't ever hear me crying
You won't hear my plea to darkness
To a go with her
To earth's core

It's Sunday, late December
And my home is filled with silence
Rambling through and through
My hallways doors
Charging every step
I dare to take
From Neath the floors
I dare to take
From Neath the floors
