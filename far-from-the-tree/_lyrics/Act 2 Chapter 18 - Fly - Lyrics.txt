Verse I
The light of the night
And daylight are blending
The skies moving slow
Fade to black
And not far away
The trees start to dress green
Winter is gone
Spring is back

Chorus
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree up ahead

Verse II
The storms that you fear
Are soon to pass over
The wind is relaxing
You see
And soon you'll be taking
A path not yet taken
Just take it
So you can fly free
Just do it before
The darkness defeats you
Just fly high
Abov all those peaks

Chorus
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree
Up ahead

Chorus
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree
Up ahead
