(sung by the God)

Verse I - 0:32
The light of the night
And daylight are blending
The skies moving slow
Fade to black
And not far away
The trees start to dress green
Winter is gone
Spring is back

Chorus - 1:19
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly  
But there're blooming tree up ahead

Verse II - 2:03
The storms that you fear
Are soon to pass over
The wind is relaxing
You see and soon you'll be taking
A path not yet taken
Just take it, so you can fly free
Just do it before
The darkness defeats you
Just fly high
Above all those peaks

Chorus - 2:59
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword 
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly  
But there're blooming tree up ahead

Bridge with Solo - 3:38

Chorus - 4:08
The choices we make
Are not easy
Not easy
Damocles' sword
Hangs by a thread
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly
So chilly
But there're blooming tree up ahead
The peaks that will front us
Are chilly  
But there're blooming tree up ahead
