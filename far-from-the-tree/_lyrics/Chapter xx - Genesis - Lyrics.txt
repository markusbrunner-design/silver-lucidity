Verse I - 1:22
When I was born
I was sweet as an angel
I had no worries
Had no doubts
I ruled up the skies
Forever and ever
Lighter than feathers
Faster than light
Faster than light

Chorus I - 2:12
My father is fierce, yes
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is righteous
My father is holy
My father is good
Daddy cares

Verse II - 2:53
When I was home
I never felt sadness
But little I knew
What waits up ahead 
The times have changed up
And not for the better
Now I'm so far 
And so sad
And so sad

Chorus II - 3:42
My father is mighty
My father is fearless
My father is heartless
And don't seem to care
How deep I had fallen
How lonely I'm feeling
How dark I've became
And how scared
How dark I've became
And how scared

Verse III - 4:22
When I was born
I was free as an angel
I had no worries
Oh, I had no doubts
But nobody told me
Hell, nobody warned me
Reality hurts
Hell, it bites
Hell, it bites
It bites

Chorus III - 5:12
Now I'm alone
Now I have nothing
Nothing but heartaches
Nothing but pain
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
And now I am falling
again
And now I am falling
again

Chorus IV - 5:52
My father is fierce and
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is hiding
My father has vanished
He's not to be found
Anywhere

Outro - Spoken fast - 6:38
He's not to be found
Anywhere
