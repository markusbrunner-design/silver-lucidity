(sung by "God" "Brother Jesus" "The Holy Spirit" & "The Angel")

[Brother Jesus]
Verse I - 0:21
You fell down to earth
That felt like forever
You fell to the ground
And down on your knees
You fell from so high
No one was your savior
You fell down so hard
And so far from the tree

["God" "Brother Jesus" & "The Holy Spirit"]
Chorus - 0:50
Far from the tree
Far from your home
Far from your place
And your true airborne form
Far from your crib
Far from your creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

[God]
Verse II.1 - 1:28
Far from the tree
And my heavenly rage
You found up your way
And the key to your cage

[Brother Jesus]
Verse II.2 - 1:42
The key to your cell
And the key to your shackles 
The key to break free
From God's anger and hackles

["God" "Brother Jesus" & "The Holy Spirit"]
Chorus - 1:57
Far from the tree
Far from your home
Far from your place
And your true airborne form
Far from your crib
Far from your creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

["God"]
Bridge - 2:26 (2:41 vocals, 3:09 guitar-solo)
You were bound to leave
Your home in the skies
You felt sorrow and grief
But by now you know why
There's a goddamn good reason
For all I have done
I love you my angel
I love you my son

[The Angel] (other lyrics)
Chorus - 3:23
Far from the tree 
And it's poisonous fruits
I sowed all my seeds
And I planted my roots
I thank you dear father
For cutting me loose
For now I can fly
And I now know the truth

["God" "Brother Jesus" & "The Holy Spirit"]
Chorus - 3:23
Far from the tree
Far from your home
Far from your place
And your true airborne form
Far from your crib
Far from your creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received
