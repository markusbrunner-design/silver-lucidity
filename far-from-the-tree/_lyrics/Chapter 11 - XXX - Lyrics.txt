And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun
You just loved to hear
What everybody said

And you didn't understand
When you dreamed of fame and such
That the Spotlights like the sun
Will burn so much

And when everybody said
Keep your distance watch ahead
And Be carful not to fly
Up high to fast

You were quick to learn and grasp
But you soared up anyway
Leaving all the rest with nothing
but star's dust

If you fly
Much too high
You'll fall free
To the sea

And when everybody claimed
Pay the price that comes with fame
And the hounds of press just pressed with no restraints
they all wanted dirt and juice
Never gave you day of truce
Never left a single page without your name
Your shame

And when everybody stalked
Then they found you, rubbed and poked
All your scars and wounds
And all your bleeding cuts

And they left you hurt and scared
Just because they thought you're dead
And to stay like that
Was probably more smart

And when everybody said
You're as pretty as the sun
They all chased you
Like they all were madly crazed

And there're some that won't keep still
They'll besiege, until you'll kneel
They all worship you
But don't care how you feel

They will never let you down
Once they crashed you to the ground
And they never go away
And let you heal

So keep flying little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
The precious time you have

So fly high, my little bird
Never go back to your cage
You must fly, my little bird
You must be brave

Spread your wings, my little bird
Don't look back my little bird
And just try to save
The precious time you have
