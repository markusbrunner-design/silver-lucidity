Verse I 
You've travelled far and plunged into
The Sea of Galilee
You've baptized all your deepest thoughts
And washed them all away

Pre Chorus
You run so long you run so fast
Run out of breath and air
You run away your irksome past
And truth you couldn't bear

Verse II
You plunged the Sea of Galilee
Then run the suffering path
You Heard the bells of churches yell
But nothing cracked your crust

Pre Chorus
The angels tried to get at You
Sent rainy days and frost
I guess they knew since down they flew
what price there was and cost

Chorus
Your tainted heart has broke you bad
You've mortgaged up your soul
Your childish pride had drove you wild
And made you lose control
Deceits and lies are all you knew
Your morals long been gone
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

Bridge
You had your share of grief and pain
You went the suffering path
You walked the vale
You've been through hell
But now you're back at last

Chorus
Your tainted heart has broke you bad
You've mortgaged up your soul
Your childish pride had drove you wild
And made you lose control
Deceits and lies are all you knew
Your morals long been gone
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

Outro
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone
