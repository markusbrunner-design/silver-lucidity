[Holy Spirit]
Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No priest or friend
Just him on his own
On his own

To hear the beat
Of heart and nothing else
Nothing else
It's good for one
To find his inner place
Inner space

To find his inner
Inner place
Inner space

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to the wind
And understand
Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
Make the change

Sometimes it's good
For one to be alone
Be alone
No God or hope
Just him
On his own
And his wrongs

To hear the beat
Of heart
And understand
Understand
It's good for him
To find his inner place
Promised land

To find his inner
Inner place
Promised land

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to
His heart
And understand
Understand
He's bound to spread
His wisdom
As the sand's
Countless grains

It's good to strip
To strip of ego and pride
All his pride
No home or land
And nothing to reflect
On his mind
On his mind
To listen to
The wind
And understand
Understand
That he's the one
That got to make a change
Make the change
