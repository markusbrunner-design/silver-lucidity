(sung by Brother Jesus)

Verse I - 0:21
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

Bridge - 1:03
God gave sinners all the best
Leaving him with heaving chest

Verse II - 1:24
How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
Got has put them to the test

Bridge - 2:07
God gave sinners every chance
But they seem to be in trans

Chorus - 2:28
Sinners always made me sad
Sinners made me raging mad
Sinners making me so spleen
God will end them for their deady sins

[Solo] - 2:48-3:23

Verse III - 3:23
Why won't sinners go away
Why they all just keep to breathe
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to cease

Bridge - 4:05
God unlocked Pandora's box
Are we all just Godly hoax

Chorus - 4:26
God made all in just a blink
Has he never stopped to think
What will his creation mean
Making all these deadly sins

Chorus - 4:47
God created sinners too
God created even you
You are evil as can be
So you're not that far from our fatherly tree
