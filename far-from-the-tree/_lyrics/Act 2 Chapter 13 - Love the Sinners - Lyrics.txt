(sung by Brother Jesus)

Verse I
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

Bridge
God gave sinners all the best
Leaving him with heaving chest

Verse II
How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
Got has put them to the test

Bridge
God gave sinners every chance
But they seem to be in trans

Chorus
Sinners always made me sad
Sinners made me raging mad
Sinners making me so spleen
God will end them for their deady sins

[Solo]

Verse III
Why won't sinners go away
Why they all just keep to breathe
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to cease

Bridge
God unlocked Pandora's box
Are we all just Godly hoax

Chorus
God made all in just a blink
Has he never stopped to think
What will his creation mean
Making all these deadly sins

Chorus
God created sinners too
God created even you
You are evil as can be
So you're not that far from God's own tree
