(sung by the God)

Verse I - 0:17
You were never
A strong believer
In my foolish fairytales
Tales of wondrous
High achievers
Men of god who never
Lost or failed

Chorus I - 0:39
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

Pre-Chorus I - 1:03
I don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for son of mine
But I get why thus they called you
Why these nicks just suit you
Rather fine

Chorus II - 1:25
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

Verse II - 1:49
I won't say that
I'm not worried
I won't say
I'm not afraid
I won't sell you
Bedtime stories
Life can never
Have a happy end

Bridge - 2:11
And I know your time gets wasted
Is it crime I waste your time
Is it crime I steal your moments
I just want to make you fine

[Guitar-Solo] - 2:22-2:34

Pre-Chorus II - 2:33
I don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for son of mine
But I get why thus they called you
Why these nicks just suit you
Rather fine

Chorus III - 2:56
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist
