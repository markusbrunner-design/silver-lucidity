Verse I
You were never
A strong believer
In my foolish fairytales
Tales of wondrous
High achievers
Men of god who never
lost or failed

Chorus
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

Pre Chorus
I don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined for
Son of mine
But I get why
Thus they called you
Why these nicks
Just suit you
Rather fine

Chorus
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist

Verse III
I won't say that I'm not worried
I won't say
I'm not afraid
I won't sell you
Bedtime stories
Life can never
Has a happy end

Bridge
And I know your time gets wasted
Is it crime I waste your time
Is it crime I steal your moments
I just want to make you fine

Pre Chorus
I don't like the dirty nicknames
People coined you
Son of mine
But I get why
Thus they called you
Why these nicks
Just suit you
Rather fine

Chorus
Don't think for a minute
That you are so different
From all of the preachers
And all of the priests
You might say they are all
Just biblical salesmen
But you are the same
With a bestial twist
