[Angel]
Verse I - 0:16
I need to build a wall
A soundproofed barrier 
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

[God]
Chorus - 0:28
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind

[Angel]
Verse II - 0:41
I need someone to guard
To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

[God]
Chorus - 0:54
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
My mind

[Angel]
Verse III - 1:19
I need to find someone
I need to have a friend
To help me slay and kill
The beasts inside my head 

[God]
Verse VI - 1:30
You have to build a wall
So you can keep your sane
A wall to stop the sounds
And agonizing pain

[God]
Chorus - 1:43
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
Mind
Mind

The sounds that try to fill
My over flooded mind
