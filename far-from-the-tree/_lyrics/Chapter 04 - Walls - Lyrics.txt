I've travelled far and plunged into
The Sea of Galilee
I've baptized all my deepest thoughts
And washed them all away

I run so long I run so fast
Run out of breath and air
I run away my irksome past
And truth I couldn't bear

I've plunged the Sea of Galilee
Then run the suffering path
I Heard the bells of churches yell
But none could crack my crust

The angels tried to get at me
Sent rainy days and frost.
I guess they knew since down they flew
what price there was and cost

My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

I had my share of grief and pain
I went the suffering path
I walked the vale I've been through hell
But now I'm back at last

My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone
