[Angel]
I need to build a wall
A soundproofed barrier 
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

[God]
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind

[Angel]
I need someone to guard
To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

[God]
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
My mind

[Angel]
I need to find someone
I need to have a friend
To help me slay and kill
The beasts inside my head 

[God]
You have to build a wall
So you can keep your sane
A wall to stop the sounds
And agonizing pain
And agonizing pain
And agonizing pain

[God]
A wall will keep you safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
Your over flooded mind
Mind
Mind
Mind

[Angel]
I need to build a wall
A soundproofed barrier 
I can't live on no more
With all the noise in there

[Angel]
I need someone to guard
To shield me from those hounds
That lurk inside my head
And force me to the ground

[Angel]
A wall will keep me safe
A wall will block the sounds
The sounds that try to fill
My over flooded mind
Mind
