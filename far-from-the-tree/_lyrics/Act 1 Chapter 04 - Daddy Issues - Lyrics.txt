Verse I - 0:32
When my dad created summer
I created fall to warn you
Just how dark and cold
Dad's winter's going to be
And I know that he's your man
Yet I urge you, think again
Is my dad is just the one
That you should fan

Chorus I - 0:59 
You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Since it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

Verse II - 1:24
When my dad created winter
I created spring to warn you
Just how hard and hot
Dad's summer's going to be
And I know in him you trust
Yet I say you surely must
Ask yourselves is your belief
Is true and just

Verse III - 1:49
When my dad created laughter
I created tears to warn you
Just how merciless
And evil dad could be
And I know in him you trust
Yet again you surely must
Understand you have to grow up
And adjust

Chorus II - 2:16
You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
Cause it's me that good old dad
Kicked out from home

Verse VI - 2:40
When my dad created living
I created death to show you 
Just how ignorant
And heartless dad could be
And I know you wish me gone
But I won't leave you alone
Not before you see how you are
All dead wrong

SOLO - 3:05

Chorus III - 3:33
You have called me many names
You've tormented and you shamed
And I understand just what
You're dreading from
And you have my dad to blame
That all mighty in which name
You have gone to wars and lost
All human form

Chorus VI - 3:57
You have called me many names
You accused and charged and claimed
And I understand just where
You're coming from
But just know I'm not to blame
And I don't feel half ashamed
And it's me that good old God
Kicked out from home
