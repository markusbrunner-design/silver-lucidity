I wish not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Someone who can blend
A part of the herd

It's not easy to be
A stranger like me
To make myself smile
All that while I feel vile

It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside me
I'm freaked
All that while
This is not easy
I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea how can I carry on
for long

I wish not to care
How everyone stare
How everyone dare
Is anyone there
Does anyone care
How I'm scared

It's not easy to be
A stranger like me
To make myself smile
All that while
I feel vile

It's not easy to keep
On laughing when deep
Inside me
I'm freaked
out and die
This is not easy
I'm scared and I'm freezing
I have no idea
How can I
carry on
For long

I wish
Not to fear
I wish I could near
Everyone else
Unseen and unheard
Just one who can blend
A part of the herd
