[Angel]
I fell down to earth
It felt like forever
I fell to the ground
And down on my knees
I fell from so high
No one was my savior
I fell down so hard
And so far from the tree

Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
And far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

Far from the tree
And the heavenly rage
I found up my way
And the key to my cage 
The key to my cell
And the key to my shackles 
The key to break free
From my anger and hackles
 
Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
Far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received

I was bound to leave
My dorms in the skies
I was bound to live
Couldn't die if I tried
There was no reason
For God's evil deeds
My God never cared
For the meek and their needs

Far from the tree
Far from my home
Far from my place
And my true airborne form
Far from my crib
And far from my creed
Far from deserving
The sentence received
Now
