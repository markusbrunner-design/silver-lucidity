[Angel]
When I was born
I was sweet as an angel
I had no worries
Had no doubts
I ruled up the skies
Forever and ever
Lighter than feathers
And faster than light
Faster than light

My father is fierce, yes
My father's all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is righteous
My father is holy
My father is good
Daddy cares

When I was home
I never felt sadness
But little I knew
Was waiting up ahead
The times have changed up
And not for the better
And now I'm so far
And so sad

My father is mighty
My father is fearless
My father is heartless
And don't seem to care
How deep I had fallen
How lonely I'm feeling
How dark I've became
And how scared
How dark I've became
And how scared

When I was born
I was free as an angel
I had no worries
Oh, I had no doubts
Nobody told me
Hell, nobody warned me
Reality hurts
Hell, it bites
Hell, it bites
It bites

Now I'm alone
Now I have nothing
Nothing but heartaches
Nothing but pain
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
I fell down so hard
It felt like forever
And now I'm falling again
I'm falling again

My father is fierce
And my father is all mighty
My father is fearless
He's just and he's fair
My father is hiding
My father has vanished
He's not to be found
Anywhere

He's not to be found
Anywhere
