Chapter xx: Walls (Sung by "God" & "The Angel")

[The Angel]

Verse I 

I've travelled far and plunged into
The Sea of Galilee
I've baptized all my deepest thoughts
And washed them all away

Pre Chorus
I run so long I run so fast
Run out of breath and air
I run away my irksome past
And truth I couldn't bear

[God]
Verse II
You plunged the Sea of Galilee
Then run the suffering path
You Heard the bells of churches yell
But nothing cracked your crust

Pre Chorus
The angels tried to get at You
Sent rainy days and frost
I guess they knew since down they flew
what price there was and cost


Chorus

[Angel]
My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul

[GOD]
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control

[Angel]
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

[The Angel]

Bridge
I had my share of grief and pain
I went the suffering path
I walked the vale I've been through hell
But now I'm back at last

[Solo]

Chorus

[Angel]
My tainted heart has broke me bad
I've mortgaged up my soul

[GOD]
My childish pride had drove me wild
And made me lose control

[Angel]
Deceits and lies are all I knew
My morals long been gone
I played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone

[God]

Outro
You played it hard then walked the yard
Among these walls of stone
