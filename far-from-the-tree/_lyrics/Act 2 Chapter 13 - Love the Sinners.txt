[Angel]
Where do all the sinners go at night
To attain their sinful dope
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to stop

God gave sinners all the best
Leaving him with heaving chest

How can all the sinners sleep at night
How can they just have a rest
I have always wondered why
God has put them to the test

God gave sinners every chance
But they seem to be in trance

Sinners always made me sad
Sinners made me raging mad
Sinners making me so spleen
God will end them for their deadly sins

Why won't sinners go away
Why they all just keep to breathe
Sinners always made me wonder why
Evil never seems to cease

God unlocked Pandora's box
Are we all just godly hoax

God made all in just a blink
Has he never stopped to think
What will his creation mean
Making all these deadly sins

God created sinners too
God created even you
You are evil as can be
So you're not that far from the fatherly tree
