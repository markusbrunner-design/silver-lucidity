[God]
You could never
Fly to heaven
Well, and even
If you could
You can't stay
Or even land there
So I don't think
That you should

You'll find there
Only strangers
Not the brothers
You have known
You will find
You don't belong there
You'll be outcast
You'll be stoned

You are not
The Rising Phoenix
You can't burn
Then live again
You're a raindrop
Once you're fallin' down
You are destined
Down the drain
You're a lost raft
You are driftin'
Off the shore
And now to sea
You're a lonely tree
You're fallin'
Down to the ground
So silently

[Angel]
I can vividly remember
How my life has used to be
How I thrived in guilty pleasures
Now I'm left with flesh debris

I must be
The Rising Phoenix
I must burn
Then live again
I'm a raindrop
I am fallin' down
To the ground and
Down the drain
I am water
I am drifting
I'm a river run
To sea
I am steamin' fumes
I'm soaring up
I'm a cloud again
I'm free

[Angel]
The Rising Phoenix
[God]
You won't burn
[Angel]
And live again
[God]
You're a raindrop
[Angel]
I am fallin' down
[God]
You are destined
[Angel]
Down the drain
[God]
You're a lost raft
