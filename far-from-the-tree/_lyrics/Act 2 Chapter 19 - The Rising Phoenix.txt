[God]
You could never
Fly to heaven
Well, and even
If you could
You can't stay
Or even land there
So I don't think
That you should

You will find there
Only strangers
Not the brothers
You have known
You will find you
Don't belong there
You'll be outcast
You'll be stoned

You are not
The Rising Phoenix
You can't burn
Then live again
You're a raindrop
Once you're falling
Down
You are destined
Down the drain
You're a lost raft
You are drifting
Off the shore and out
To sea
You're a lonely tree
You're falling down
To the ground
So silently

[Angel]
I can vividly
Remember
How my life
Has used to be
How I thrived
On guilty pleasures
Now I'm left
With flesh debris

I must be
The Rising Phoenix
I must burn
Then live again
I'm a raindrop
I am falling
Down
To the ground then
Down the drain
I am water
I am drifting
I'm a river run
To sea
I am steaming fumes
I'm soaring up
I'm a cloud again
I'm free

[Angel]
The Rising Phoenix
[God]
You won't burn
[Angel]
And live again
[God]
You're a raindrop
[Angel]
I am falling
Down
[God]
You are destined
[Angel]
Down the drain
[God]
You're a lost raft
