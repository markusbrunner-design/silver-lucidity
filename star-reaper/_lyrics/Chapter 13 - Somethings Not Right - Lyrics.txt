========================================================

Nebula, you’ve become so distant
You ignore my very existence
Haven’t spoken in so long
Something’s wrong. Something’s wrong
Won’t you please tell me what’s wrong
Won’t you please tell me what’s wrong

What are the strange signals we hear
Why’s Ground Control so hard to reach
You turn your head, don’t answer me
What does it mean
What does it mean
Tell me, what does it mean
What does it
What does it mean

Strange signals out of the cosmic night
Something’s not right, something’s not right
Not right, Not right, Not right, Not right
Not right, Not right, Not right, Not right
