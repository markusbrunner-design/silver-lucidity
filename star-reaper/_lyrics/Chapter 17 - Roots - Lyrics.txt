Roots, roots, roots
I'm searching  
Roots, roots, roots
I'm searching 
Roots, roots, roots

Search for your roots 
If you wanna be free
Roots, roots, roots

From the deepest roots
Grow the tallest trees
Roots, roots, roots

Search for your roots
If you want to be free
Roots, roots, roots

Your roots, your roots, your roots
They are the key

Canâ€™t find my roots, roots, roots
