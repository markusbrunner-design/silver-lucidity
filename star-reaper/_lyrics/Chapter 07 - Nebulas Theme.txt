Nebula, lovely as the evening star
You shone soft and warm into my life
Never imagined this for me
That I could ever feel this free
The load I carried became light
And I began to heal my scars

All that glitters is not gold
I'm not the one
I seem to be
I have no heart
Have no soul
Do not belong in your dreams

Nebula, music of the spheres
You are so young and yet so wise
I feel at least I’ve found a friend
My loneliness is at an end
Though when I gaze into your eyes
I wonder who you really are

All that glitters is not gold
I'm not the one
I seem to be
I have no heart
Have no soul
Do not belong in your dreams

Beware the mandrake’s powers
It's hidden potent charms
Flee those who have the mandrake tattooed on their arm
You have been warned
You have been warned
Abandon hope all ye who venture near

Bella Donna
Love is blind
Mandragora
Love is blind
Oh Nebula
Where are you now
