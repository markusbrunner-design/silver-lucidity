========================================================

Shaft of light
In the cosmic night
Nebula's empty spacesuit spins
A crazy puppet with no strings
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

As I stare
Numb with despair
Nebula, where I canâ€™t reach her
Is now a green, alien creature
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

A killer drone
Sets out to get me
It cuts my tether with its blade
Yet, I feel calm and unafraid
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

Sharp impact
My visor's cracked
The smell of space
Raspberries, ozone
Gunpowder
Seared steak and rum
This is for real
This is for real
This is for real

Nebula
I scream out loud
No echo
My voice makes no sound
In space the silence is profound
My end is near
My end is near
My end is near
Nebula
