In the unlikely event of disintegration at lift-off
Your relatives will be duly contacted
All funeral expenses will be covered
And a national day of mourning observed
May God be with you

Please close and lock your visors
Make sure that your seatbelt is securely fastened
We wish you a pleasant trip

Ground control to Star-Reaper One
You task is to intercept, capture and 
Neutralize any alien life form in HR 6819

Relevant to the destruction of any 
Alien life eco-system
Astronauts Nebula and Sol will

This is Siria, your virtual assistant
We have reached our cruising speed of 25 000 mph
Due to weightlessness, we strongly advise
You keep your seatbelts fastened
Unless you have duties to perform
Thank you for your attention

Immensity of space
Immensity of time
Immense stupidity of human pride
In space, there is nowhere to hide
Letâ€™s hope that God is on our side

This is Siria, your virtual assistant
We have left the confines of our Galaxy
And passed the point of no possible return to Earth
We would like to thank you for flying Star Reaper

We regret not being able to
Welcome you on any further flights
We wish you a pleasant
Onward journey to infinity
