========================================================

I was eight years old
When my Dad died
I saw his ship explode on TV live
Didn’t make it through
Earth’s atmosphere
Space pioneer
On the last frontier

No

Mom was so heart-broken
She took her life
Losing him, then her
Cut me like a knife
I didn’t have any next of kin
Different foster homes took me in 

My Bud Lightyear toy was my only friend 
My Bud Lightyear toy was my only friend 

I miss my Dad
I miss my Mom 
Fall-out after an atomic bomb
Alone and lonely
Not good in my skin 
School of hard knocks
Take it on the chin

My Bud Lightyear toy
They took it away 
Said I was too old
No more time for play 
At school I tried
Never quite fit in
But was good at sports
With the rage to win 

Good with computers
Not with humans
Didn’t mix with the other students

Thought I was a rock, was an island 
Thought I was a rock, was an island  

Into my life there shone no light 
The black dog came for me at night 
Didn’t feel I could persevere 
My future was uncertain and unclear
Felt I’d already paid too high a price
No-one to turn to for advice 
Eight years now my Dad’s been dead 
I know what he would have said 
Fall, rise again
Never give in 

I wish I could be Bud Lightyear for real
Leave this Earth behind
At last be free

Outer space is where I belong 
Like Dad, infinity and beyond 
Outer space is where I belong 
Like Dad, infinity and beyond
