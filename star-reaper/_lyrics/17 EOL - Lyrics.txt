========================================================

This is SRN breaking news
Sol, our best and brightest astronaut
Has met with a tragic death
Attempting to rescue his co-pilot during an EVA
I am with two of his instructors 
On the Star-Reaper program
Dr Susan Bokowski and Professor Steven Hillage
Tell me, what are your feelings today
Knowing that Sol is now lost in space forever

I'm devastated, just devastated
So, so sad that he should suffer 
The same fate as his Dad
It's strange to say but, maybe somehow
He has at last found his roots

Sol had dreamed of space since he was a kid
Today, he has reaped the stars 
May God bless him 
And may his soul rest in peace
