========================================================

Who knows what might have been
Met her when I was just eighteen
I had hoped she’d be my queen
Oh,woh,oh,oh, my love’s in danger

Now she’s out there on her own
Said I should remain on board alone
But I can feel it in my bones
Oh,woh,oh,oh, my love’s in danger

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
No way I can save her
Now she’s in danger
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
No way I can save her
Now she’s in danger
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her

Who knows what might have been
Met her when I was just eighteen
Now I’ll be forever lonely
I didn’t tell her she’s my one and only

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
No way I can save her
Now she’s in danger
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
My love’s in danger
Lord, have mercy
My love’s in danger
Lord, have mercy
My love’s in danger
No way I can save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
My love’s in danger
Danger
