========================================================

Who knows what might have been
Met her when I was just eighteen
I had hoped she’d be my queen
Woh-oh-woh-oh, my love’s in danger

Now she’s out there on her own
Said I should remain on board all alone
But I can feel it in my bones
Woh-oh-oh, my love’s in danger

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
She's in danger
And I can’t save her
I can’t save her
She's in danger
She's in danger
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
She's in danger
And I can’t save her
I can’t save her
She's in danger
She's in danger
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her

Who knows what might have been
Met her when I was just eighteen
Now I’ll be forever lonely
I didn’t tell her she’s my one and only

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
She's in danger
And I can’t save her
I can’t save her
She's in danger
She's in danger
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
I can’t save her

My love's in danger
She's in danger
I can't save her
I can't save her
My love's in danger
She's in danger
I can't save her
I can't save her
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
My love's in danger
I can't save her
Danger
