Darris Island Boot Camp
The weather’s cold and damp
4 am. They wake us up
Calling us all buttercup

You just here to sightsee
Drill sergeant screams at me
Get your butt over that wall
I’ll fail you if you fall

Discipline is really tough
Seems your best is not enough
But there’s camaraderie
Feel I found my family

One of the female recruits
Beautiful and strong to boot
Awesome to see in combat
Can knock a guy out flat

Talking to her yesterday
Like me she dreams of space
Strange green tattoo on her arm
Won’t tell me where she’s from

Nebula is her first name
Knowing her has changed my game
She’s a friend that I can trust
Both dreaming about stardust
