========================================================

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad
For infinity and beyond
So far far away from here
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond

I feel so tied down on this planet
People got hearts and brains like granite
Conform to the norms
Choose the right toys
Pink for the girls
Blue for the boys
Conform to the norms
Do the right thing
Conform to the norms

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad
For infinity and beyond
So far far away from here
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond

Wanna float free in my spacesuit
Heavensward with no escape route
A one-way ticket
To the galaxy
Disobey the norms
Oh Final fantasy
It's a one-way ticket
Do the right thing
A one-way ticket

What's it like to be weightless in space
Does your mind feel weightless too
That would be so cool
Does your mind feel weightless too
That would be too cool

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad
For infinity and beyond
So far far away from here
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
Never come back
