========================================================

There is no shadow without light
No light without a shadow
However bright the light may glow
Its alter ego is the night

Drawn like a moth into the flame
I guess I was bound to loose the game
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Once in its hold, no going back

The green tattoo upon your wrist
Was a strange and tortured shape
Just a plant you said, a mandrake
Half human, half flower
Said to possess superpowers
Now gimme a break, you hissed

There is no shadow without light
No light without a shadow
However bright the light may glow
Its alter ego is the night

Drawn like a moth into the flame
I guess I was bound to loose the game
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Once in its hold, no going back

You scraped your arm near the tattoo
I saw bright green drops, thick as blood
Tattoo ink you said, all’s good
Back off, you snarled
Keep away, you’ll get hurt bad
Hear what I say
Oh Nebula
I never knew

Alarm bells sounded but I didn’t listen
Mandrake root screamed but I didn’t hear
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Toxic, toxic, toxic
