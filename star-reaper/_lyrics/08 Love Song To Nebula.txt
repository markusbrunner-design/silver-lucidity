Hello, my name is Nebula

Nebula, Nebula
Bella Donna
Nebula, Nebula
Mandragora

The first time ever I saw your face
I was amazed to see such grace
Your green eyes held me mesmerized
As if I had been magnetized
Oh, Nebula

The first time ever I heard your name
I felt my life was gonna change
The mandrake tattoo on your arm
Murmured of mysterious charm
Oh, Nebula

The first time ever I spoke with you
It was like a fresh breeze blew
Touched my heart and awoke my soul
Someone who could make me whole
Oh, Nebula

I would reap the stars for you
Make roses grow on Mars for you
Invert the north south poles for you
Explore every black hole for you

Nebula, Nebula
Bella Donna
Nebula, Nebula
Mandragora

I am yours to command
For infinity and beyond
