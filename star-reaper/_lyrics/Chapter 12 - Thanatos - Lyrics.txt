Thanatos
God of death, spares no-one

Red light at the airlock
Oxygen depleted
Forman’s trapped inside
The door won’t open
Helpless, I watch him die

One black body bag in the hold
Lord have mercy on his soul

Gotta get some sleep
Cos we’re all exhausted
We’ll talk in the morning
In the night, Thanatos strike
Jackson’s dead
No warning

Two black body bags in the hold
Ground control’s got to be told

Two black body bags in the hold
Nebula and me now, that’s all

Nebula and me
Trust is gone
Each on their guard against the other one

Thanatos
God of Death
You reign eternal
