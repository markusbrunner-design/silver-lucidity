========================================================

You're ready to spacewalk
You stand in the airlock
I close the inside door
Place my hand on the glass
I mouth be careful
You wave goodbye
Strange gleam in your eye

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Oh my God, Oh my God
She's detached from the pod
Nebula, Nebula
Come in, do you read me
Mayday, Mayday
Your radio's out
In space you can't shout

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Quick, Spacesuit, Helmet
Feel my heart is melting
Step outside the ship
For my rescue mission
Where is she now
I can't see her
Everything's a blur

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

A giant space-ship Death Star
Undetected by radar
Looms above my head 
A shaft of light beams down
On Nebula
Slowly morphing
Alien mutant boarding

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Suddenly all is clear
Made real all my fears
The mandrake tattoo
The green blood on your arm
Superhuman strength
Me blind from love
Saw the sheep not the wolf

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Betrayed
Betrayed
Betrayed
Someone wake me from this nightmare
