Excuse me, Professor Jackson
There are reports some aliens
Can take on human form
Can’t tell the difference
Until they bleed
Because their blood is green
Is that possible
In your professional opinion

This is where our duty lies
Alien life to be identified
Beware they may be humanized
Alien life to be neutralized

This is where our duty lies
Alien life to be identified
Beware they may be humanized
Alien life to be neutralized

Well, Dr Forman
We have no scientific proof
To proove or disprove these reports
From your geological data
It appears mammal life could exist
Sol and Nebula
Do you have any input on this matter

This is where our duty lies
Alien life to be identified
Beware they may be humanized
Alien life to be neutralized

This is where our duty lies
Alien life to be identified
Beware they may be humanized
Alien life to be neutralized

No sir, we have no such information
We are trained to run the spacecraft
And ensure the safety of all crew members
I have heard only rumors
And Nebula... Nebula
Yeah, nice sci-fi story
Not at all credible
Now, if you’ll excuse me
I gotta get back to work
