Presenter (Markus):
This is SRN breaking news. 
Sol, our best and brightest astronaut has met 
with a tragic death attempting to rescue his co-pilot during an EVA. 
I am with two of his instructors on the Star-Reaper program, 
Dr Susan Bokowski and Professor Steven Hillage. 
Tell me, what are your feelings today, 
knowing that Sol is now lost in space forever?

0:50 - 1:03
Dr Bokowski (Elizabeth)
I'm devastated, just devastated. 
So, so sad that he should suffer the same fate as his Dad. 
Strange to say but, maybe somehow, he has at last found his roots

1:04 - 1:15
Prof. SH (Cree)
Sol had dreamed of space since he was a kid. Today, 
he has reaped the stars. May God bless him and my his 
soul rest in peace.
