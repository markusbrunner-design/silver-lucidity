Space-wayfarer en route to Mars
Marvels at Earth shining blue bright
In the darkling, rayless night

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

In the black vacuum of deep space
Dead stars in a dizzying dance
Leave the wayfarer entranced

Wayfarer tethered to his spaceship
Floating like an unborn child 
In a new world undefiled

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

Stealthy alien monolith  
Reflected in his visor
Wayfarer dies no wiser

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

You reap what you sow
Iâ€™m reaping the stars
