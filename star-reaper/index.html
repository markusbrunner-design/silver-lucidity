Space-wayfarer en route to Mars
Marvels at Earth shining blue bright
In the darkling, rayless night

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

In the black vacuum of deep space
Dead stars in a dizzying dance
Leave the wayfarer entranced

Wayfarer tethered to his spaceship
Floating like an unborn child
In a new world undefiled

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

Stealthy alien monolith
Reflected in his visor
Wayfarer dies no wiser

Beyond man and time
Beyond good and evil
Beyond life and death
Zarathustra waits

You reap what you sow
I’m reaping the stars

Good morning

This is SRN breaking news

Wayfarer 2, flagship of the Star-Reaper
Program, has exploded re-entering
Earth's atmosphere

The experienced crew, Bob Spencer
Chuck Mallory, Luis Hernandez all lost their lives

The origin of the accident is as yet unknown

Debris from the spacecraft is scattered in the
Stratosphere and will continue to orbit our planet

The accident is a great setback for
Our country's space program

It is a tragic day for our brave astronauts'
Families to whom we offer our sincere
Condolences

This is SRN Breaking News

I was eight years old when my Dad died
I saw his spaceship explode on TV live
Didn’t make it through Earth’s atmosphere
Space pioneer on the last frontier

Mom was so heart-broken, she took her life
Losing him, then her cut me like a knife
I didn’t have any next of kin
Different foster homes took me in

My Bud Lightyear toy was my only friend
My Bud Lightyear toy was my only friend

I miss my Dad
I miss my Mom
Fall-out after an atomic bomb
Alone and lonely
Not good in my skin
School of hard knocks
Take it on the chin

My Bud Lightyear toy
They took it away
Said I was too old
No more time for play
At school I tried
I never quite fit in
But was good at sports
With the rage to win

Good with computers not with humans
Didn’t mix with the other students

Thought I was a rock, was an island
Thought I was a rock, was an island

Into my life there shone no light
The black dog came for me at night
Didn’t feel I could persevere
My future was uncertain and unclear
Felt I’d already paid too high a price
No-one to turn to for advice
Eight years now my Dad’s been dead
I know what he would have said
Fall, rise again
Never give in

I wish I could be Bud Lightyear for real
Leave this Earth behind, at last be free

Outer space is where I belong
Like Dad, infinity and beyond
Outer space is where I belong
Like Dad, infinity and beyond

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad
For infinity and beyond
So far far away from here
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond

I feel so tied down on this planet
People got hearts and brains like granite
Conform to the norms
Choose the right toys
Pink for the girls
Blue for the boys
Conform to the norms
Do the right thing
Conform to the norms

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad
For infinity and beyond
So far far away from here
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond
For infinity and beyond

Wanna float free in my spacesuit
Heavensward with no escape route
A one-way ticket
To the galaxy
Disobey the norms
Oh Final fantasy
It's a one-way ticket
Do the right thing
A one-way ticket

What's it like to be weightless in space
Does your mind feel weightless too
That would be so cool
Does your mind feel weightless too
That would be too cool

Three, two, one, zero

Wanna be a space hero
See what they see
Feel what they feel
A Bud Lightyear for real
Wanna be just like my dad

Darris Island Boot Camp
The weather’s cold and damp
4 am. They wake us up
Calling us all buttercup

You just here to sightsee
Drill sergeant screams at me
Get your butt over that wall
I’ll fail you if you fall

Discipline is really tough
Seems your best is not enough
But there’s camaraderie
Feel I found my family

One of the female recruits
Beautiful and strong to boot
Awesome to see in combat
Can knock a guy out flat

Talking to her yesterday
Like me she dreams of space
Strange green tattoo on her arm
Won’t tell me where she’s from

Nebula is her first name
Knowing her has changed my game
She’s a friend that I can trust
Both dreaming about stardust

Nebula, lovely as the evening star
You shone soft and warm into my life
Never imagined this for me
That I could ever feel this free
The load I carried became light
And I began to heal my scars

All that glitters is not gold
I'm not the one
I seem to be
I have no heart
Have no soul
Do not belong in your dreams

Nebula, music of the spheres
You are so young and yet so wise
I feel at least I’ve found a friend
My loneliness is at an end
Though when I gaze into your eyes
I wonder who you really are

All that glitters is not gold
I'm not the one
I seem to be
I have no heart
Have no soul
Do not belong in your dreams

Beware the mandrake’s powers
It's hidden potent charms
Flee those who have the mandrake tattooed on their arm
You have been warned
You have been warned
Abandon hope all ye who venture near

Bella Donna
Love is blind
Mandragora
Love is blind
Oh Nebula
Where are you now

As if I had been magnetized
Oh, Nebula

The first time ever I heard your name
I felt my life was gonna change
The mandrake tattoo on your arm
Murmured of mysterious charm
Oh, Nebula

The first time ever I spoke with you
It was like a fresh breeze blew
Touched my heart and awoke my soul
Someone who could make me whole
Oh, Nebula

I would reap the stars for you
Make roses grow on Mars for you
Invert the north south poles for you
Explore every black hole for you

Nebula, Nebula

I am yours to command

Welcome on board Star-Reaper One
In the unlikely event of disintegration at lift-off
Your relatives will be duly contacted
All funeral expenses will be covered
And a national day of mourning observed
May God be with you

Ground control to Star-Reaper One
Your mission is classified top secret defence
Alien activity has been detected in the
Local Interstellar cloud Black Hole HR 6819
In the constellation of Telescopium
Has been emitting suspicious radio waves at 1420 MHz
Its techno-signature has been validated as
Hostile by space agencies worldwide

This is Siria, your virtual assistant
Lift-off is imminent
Our ascent will take 6.5 min
G Forces will increase to 2.5 over this period
Please close and lock your visors
Make sure that your seatbelt is securely fastened
We wish you a pleasant trip

Ground control to Star-Reaper One
You task is to intercept, capture and 
Neutralize any alien life form in HR 6819
Professor Jackson, you will dissect
Identify and classify its DNA
Dr. Forman, you will study geological data
Relevant to the destruction of any 
Alien life eco-system
Astronauts Nebula and Sol will
Ensure the safety of the crew

This is Siria, your virtual assistant
We have reached our cruising speed of 25 000 mph
Due to weightlessness, we strongly advise
You keep your seatbelts fastened
Unless you have duties to perform
Thank you for your attention

Immensity of space
Immensity of time
Immense stupidity of human pride
In space, there is nowhere to hide
Let’s hope that God is on our side

This is Siria, your virtual assistant
We have left the confines of our Galaxy
And passed the point of no possible return to Earth
We would like to thank you for flying Star Reaper

We regret not being able to
Welcome you on any further flights
We wish you a pleasant
Onward journey to infinity

There is no shadow without light
No light without a shadow
However bright the light may glow
Its alter ego is the night

Drawn like a moth into the flame
I guess I was bound to loose the game
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Once in its hold, no going back

The green tattoo upon your wrist
Was a strange and tortured shape
Just a plant you said, a mandrake
Half-human, half flower 
Said to possess superpowers
Now gimme a break, you hissed

There is no shadow without light
No light without a shadow
However bright the light may glow
Its alter ego is the night

Drawn like a moth into the flame
I guess I was bound to loose the game
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Once in its hold, no going back

You scraped your arm near the tattoo
I saw bright green drops, thick as blood
Tattoo ink you said
All’s good, back off, you snarled
Keep away, you’ll get hurt bad
Hear what I say
Oh Nebula, I never knew

Alarm bells sounded but I didn’t listen
Mandrake root screamed but I didn’t hear
Mandrake magic, toxic and black
Toxic, toxic, toxic

Now she’s in danger
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her

Who knows what might have been
Met her when I was just eighteen
Now I’ll be forever lonely
I didn’t tell her she’s my one and only

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
Now she’s in danger
No way I can save her
Now she’s in danger
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her

Now she’s a stranger
And I can’t change her
My love’s in danger
Lord, have mercy
My love’s in danger
Lord, have mercy
My love’s in danger
No way I can save her
Lord have mercy
I can’t save her
My love’s in danger
Danger

You're ready to spacewalk
You stand in the airlock
I close the inside door
Place my hand on the glass
I mouth be careful
You wave goodbye
Strange gleam in your eye

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Oh my God, Oh my God
She's detached from the pod
Nebula, Nebula
Come in, do you read me
Mayday, Mayday
Your radio's out
In space you can't shout

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Quick, Spacesuit, Helmet
Feel my heart is melting
Step outside the ship
For my rescue mission
Where is she now
I can't see her
Everything's a blur

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

A giant space-ship Death Star
Undetected by radar
Looms above my head
A shaft of light beams down
On Nebula
Slowly morphing
Alien mutant boarding

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Suddenly all is clear
Made real all my fears
The mandrake tattoo
The green blood on your arm
Superhuman strength
Me blind from love
Saw the sheep not the wolf

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

You stepped out
Out into space
Broke the faith
Betrayed me

Betrayed
Betrayed
Betrayed
Someone wake me from this nightmare

Shaft of light
In the cosmic night
Nebula's empty spacesuit spins
A crazy puppet with no strings
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

As I stare
Numb with despair
Nebula, where I can’t reach her
Is now a green, alien creature
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

A killer drone
Sets out to get me
It cuts my tether with its blade
Yet, I feel calm and unafraid
Can this be for real
Can this be for real
Can this be for real

Sharp impact
My visor's cracked
The smell of space
Raspberries, ozone
Gunpowder
Seared steak and rum
This is for real
This is for real
This is for real

Nebula
I scream out loud
No echo
My voice makes no sound
In space the silence is profound
My end is near
My end is near
My end is near
Nebula

Presenter
This is SRN breaking news
Sol, our best and brightest astronaut
Has met a tragic death 
Attempting to rescue his co-pilot during an EVA
I am with two of his instructors 
On the Star-Reaper program
Dr Susan Bokowski and Professor Steven Hillage
Tell me, what are your feelings today
Knowing that Sol is now lost in space forever

Dr. Bokowski
I'm devastated, just devastated
So, so sad that he should suffer 
The same fate as his Dad
Strange to say but, maybe somehow 
He has at last found his roots

Prof. Hillage
Sol had dreamed of space since he was a kid 
Today, he has reaped the stars 
May God bless him 
And may his soul rest in peace
