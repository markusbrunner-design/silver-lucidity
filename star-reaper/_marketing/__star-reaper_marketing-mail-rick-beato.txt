My name is Markus Brunner. I'm a guitarist and songwriter based in Germany. I lead a core team of three musicians, from both sides of the Atlantic. (Cree Patterson, vocalist, from Texas and Elizabeth Auzan, lyricist, from Switzerland and myself).

We have never physically met and yet managed to write a whole rock opera concept album together in the space of two months working on the Kompoz.com collaborative music site. As you can see above, we have also produced the digital booklet above where you can find all tracks and lyrics to "Star-Reaper".

This experience was so enriching that we want to promote this way of working by getting our album known. We are already working on a second album, 42, in reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...

The Beato book has been an inspiration for me. We are all long-time fans of yours. From musician, producer and entrepreneur to your YouTube channel today you have adapted to new technology making your way up thanks to great content. What resonates particularly with us, in our current situation, is that you seem not to have had any specific mentor, working alone, building connections, in short, getting collaborators on board. Your success was born of hard work and « can do » approach. We admire you for that as well as for the awesome content of your videos. Online media is definitely the future, even if it's nice to have vinyls back ! Star-Reaper will be available soon on Spotify.

For all these reasons, we're reaching out to you today to ask you to give our album a listen. Your time is precious, so we've highlighted the following tracks.
- 07 Nebula's Theme
- 10 The Girl With The Mandrake Tattoo
- 16 In space no one can hear you scream

Our greatest hope is that you would do a video on the topic of remote collaboration where the making of our first album could be showcased.

We understand that you are no doubt snowed under with similar requests!
So, if a video is not on the cards, we would really appreciate any feedback you could give in terms of mix/production and any pointers to help us get our music heard online.

Whatever comes of this request, thank you for reading down to here.

We wish you all the best and look forward to seeing more fantastic videos on your channel.

Markus, Cree, Elizabeth and our guest musicians
