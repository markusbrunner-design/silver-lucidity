"STAR-REAPER" 

Space X, Elon Musk, Virgin Galactic. Ticket for the moon, anyone? A bargain at 35 million dollars! You don't even need to be a trained astronaut. Space travel, at least to the moon seems to represent just another consumer item. A box to tick if you have the money.
We wanted to take a more romanticized view of the experience, drawing on the many literary or movie masterpieces space travel has inspired.
We invite you to board Star-Reaper One and follow the adventures of Sol.

Enjoy the trip!

We would love to hear from you as you detect any references to movies or songs which inspired us. We will add your names as additional crew on the digital booklet!
