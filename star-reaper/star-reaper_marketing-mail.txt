My name is Markus Brunner. I'm a guitarist and songwriter based in Germany. I lead a core team of three musicians, from both sides of the Atlantic. (Cree Patterson, vocalist, from Texas and Elizabeth Auzan, lyricist, from Switzerland and myself).


We have never physically met and yet managed to write a whole rock opera concept album together in the space of two months working on the Kompoz.com collaborative music site. As you can see above, we have also produced the digital booklet above where you can find all tracks and lyrics to "Star-Reaper".


This experience was so enriching that we want to promote this way of working by getting our album known. We are already working on a new album, 42, in reference to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy...


Star-Reaper will be available soon on Spotify and other platforms (1st June 2021).


For all these reasons, we're reaching out to you today to ask you to give our album a listen. Your time is precious, so we've highlighted the following tracks.
- 07 Nebula's Theme
- 10 On Board
- 16 In Space No-One Can Hear You Scream


Our greatest hope is that you would do an issue on the topic of remote collaboration where the making of our first album could be showcased.


We understand that you are no doubt snowed under with similar requests!
So, if a topic about us is not on the cards, we would really appreciate any feedback you could give in terms of mix/production and any pointers to help us get our music heard online.


Whatever comes of this request, thank you for reading down to here.


We wish you all the best and look forward to seeing more fantastic topics on your channel.


Markus, Cree, Elizabeth and our guest musicians
