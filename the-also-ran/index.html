Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

We started out in a shed
Having big dreams of what's ahead
Local promo Local gigs
Thinking this is the life to live
Convinced that fame was in the air
Living on a song and a prayer

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

Out on the road we felt real proud
Party hard
We'll draw the crowd
No interest from the record scouts
Eventually the money ran out
Then our Manager let us down
We couldn't make it on our own

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

The pop music world is like an ocean
Deep and dark
Perpetual motion
Small fish eaten
Ambitions broken
Many are called
Few are chosen

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

When I was 19
I was out on my own
I had no clue
Just floating in the vast unknown
Lived right above
The place that I worked
Washing dishes every night
And sweeping up the dirt

In the shed out back
Drinking beer, singing songs
Chord books in hand
They played guitars, I'd sing along
We talked about how cool it would be
To see yourself jammin' on TV
In the shed out back
That's where dreams were made
Making a living on a stage

Some players stayed
Some left
I was sad to see them go
But we never stopped playing
Wven when it was windy and cold
Finally found a drummer who could
Keep us in time
Add a bass and
Everything gets real tight

In the shed out back
Drinking beer, singing songs
Chord books in hand
They played guitars, I'd sing along
We talked about how cool it would be
To see yourself jammin' on TV
In the shed out back
That's where dreams were made
Making a living on a stage

C'mon we'll jam all night
You play a song and
I'll sing along
Dreams

There's got to be more
Than what we are doing here
It stirs inside my soul
The shed is dark
The way is clear
We need to find a way
To step right up
And somehow grow out of this shadow

We'll reach out to every musician
Let them hear these words
We got a place with sound equipment
Hey you, let your soul be heard
It's time, play music come together
Why don't you join us in the backroom
We got pizza and beer and Rock & Roll
If you dare

Come on down and bring your partner
If you play or just want to dance
It's right here, don't look no further
Right here at the Backroom Jam
Sing and Play
Have a good time
Right here at the Backroom Jam

That first big step started out slowly
No one showed up it was just the guys and me
On the Greens, played guitars, at the university
The next thing you know
We're celebrities

We'll reach out to every musician
Let them hear these words
We got a place with sound equipment
Hey you, let your soul be heard
It's time, play music come together
Why don't you join us in the backroom
We got pizza and beer and Rock & Roll
If you dare

Come on down and bring your partner
If you play or just want to dance

Hey you
Get in line
Don't stand there and talk
If you wanna get inside
Because it's time to rock
In The Library
You don't need no books
You just bring your student rage
We're gonna use it all
To get you out of your cage
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Come in and don't be shy
Here's the situation
Let go, have fun
It's higher education
In The Library
Dancin', drinkin' all night long
Here's the lesson learned
Watch out who you do
Because you just might get burned
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Something's just not right
There's a man with a gun over there
I'm on a break, sitting backstage
He smiles and says don't stare
I can't help but wonder out loud
Why, what's next, he nods and says
You gotta play the game
Then burnout and fade away

Yeah! Here I am set after set
Night after night
Is this my dream
Play the game
Get it right
In The Library
Do I tell the others what went down
Do they care about what I found
Is this the risk or am I
The also ran
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

So I told the boys and we all agreed
Safer for us to break down and leave
Not so fast
So you know
You still owe
In The Library

Now the rules of the game
Have been read
Much easier to play than be dead
Watch your back
Have some heart
Now you've learned your part
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Is this the right way to go
Gonna play my part
Don't wanna be
Burned out and fade away
No also ran
The rules of the game
So here I am
In the Library
In the Library
Learnin' in the Library
So this is your dream
Not quite what it seems
Will you play
Play the game
Then burnout and fade away
Play the game

Sun goes down on the desert tonight
Pastel colors and fire fill the sky
Behind me the mighty Superstitions stand
Majestic, Eerie, Ohh
They do not lie
Here I stand on a stage on Main street
An old Western movie set and back lot
Tonight we'll open our next adventure
As we move forward
Hey this is our shot

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high

Can you feel it from the crowd
The lights and the sound
There's magic in the air
People jumping up and down
Smiling faces all around
It's a buzz that we share
Song after song
Beat after beat
Everybody dancing in the street
The mountains echo our vibe
Such a beautiful place to be
Everybody open and free
Even old spirits
From the Apache tribe

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high

There she stood right in front of me
Oh my god, who can this Goddess be
Blonde hair, blue eyes
Hair in a bandanna
I've got to meet this girl
They call Hannah

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high

Sign with me and you'll go far

I wanna go into business with you
And we'll call it Stealer

We'll tour it up and down the Coast
We'll make money and you'll make friends
You'll be a rock and roll star

Hey, Hey Hannah
The girl from Santa Ana
Who knows every cartel
Oh, west of Havana
You say we passed the test
And you would like to invest
Sweet, Sweet Hannah
Yeah, we really wanna

First you sign on the dotted line
Then we'll figure out the rest
You're gonna need a truck and a van
Good equipment will make you the best
Start in the South to get warmed up
Wait till Spring has sprung
Then boogie North to the promised land
Stop at every College town

Hey, Hey Hannah

Who knows every cartel
Oh, west of Havana

London Bridge is fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down
London Bridge is fallin' down
Fallin' down
Sell it before it hits the ground

Feel the sun, ohh, smell the air
See the bridge rebuilt over there
I could walk to California 
With all the boats on the lake
A Birthday Party is why we’re here
So come one, come all
Let’s celebrate

Build the bridge and they will come
There’s no more work to be done
Build the bridge and they will come
Toes in the water havin' fun

Build the bridge and they will come
July 4th in the sun
Build the bridge and they will come
Two-hundred years the party’s on

Look around such a beautiful sight
Tanned bodies sway into the night
If we could stop and freeze time
This frozen frame would be mine
So many people escape their lives
As the sun goes down
Givin' way to a pale moon light

Glistening shadows
Moving madly
In the darkness
Behaving badly
In out, In out, In out

Build the bridge and they will come
There’s no more work to be done
Build the bridge and they will come
Toes in the water havin' fun

Build the bridge and they will come
July 4th in the sun
Build the bridge and they will come

Lean and buff and oh so handsome
That look in his eyes
He’s got the answers
Clean and tight and oh so nice
When he decides to take you home tonight
Don’t get to attached, he’s not for sale
He’s an alpha male

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah
Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye

When he struts in
He’s dressed for action
All the girls
They feel the attraction
When he moves
He skates on ice
Glides right up
To his prey tonight
The wink in his eye
The perfect smile
Locked and loaded
He’s got his girl

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah
Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye

Oh no, what did you do
Your ego’s got the best of you
Lie and smile
At the same time
There’s one girl
That’s wise to your crime
You skimmed profits
That belong to her
She’s coming for you
That much is sure
You can’t run
You can’t hide
Cause Hannah’s got you
In her sights

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah

There’s a girl I met
Her name is Naomi
She has issue’s
Nobody told me
She lives her life 
With the monkey on her back
I didn’t know 
Until I saw her tracks
Long dark hair, hazel eyes
She’s so pretty
It’s just a shame
Her heart is empty

They call her Stagger Lee
Walks in and smiles at me
She’s wearing shades in the dark
But there’s a hole in her heart
When you gonna get out of your funk
Stagger Lee
It’s time to give up the junk
Stagger Lee
Walk and talk and you’re alive
Stagger Lee
Can’t you see

When Naomi comes around
She’s cool, so calm
Cooks, cleans, sews
Just like a second Mom
But when Stagger Lee appears
You’re gonna hide your head
Cause her eyes crave
Like the undead
Veins full of the demon seed
She just stumbles and mumbles

They call her Stagger Lee
Walks in and smiles at me
She’s wearing shades in the dark
But there’s a hole in her heart
When you gonna get out of your funk
Stagger Lee
It’s time to give up the junk
Stagger Lee
Walk and talk and you’re alive
Stagger Lee
Can’t you see

I'm finally comin' Home
I've been gone for quite a while
I think of you everyday now
In my mind I count the miles
Your love springs eternal
Cuts through the armor
Straight to my heart
I believe I need you beside me
Give up this life on the road
And make a new start

I'm dreaming in my bed
Another night without you
Your eyes they talk to me
Tell me what I got to do
Can't get it through my head
I'm hypnotized it's true
Everyday's a cool breeze
Because of you

I've searched high and low
With no luck
Trying to find an open door
Been lied to
By smiling faces
All they wanted
Was the next score
Since I met you
I see a real future
One that's not run
By lust and greed
I've worked so hard
To try and make it
Now I realize
You're all I need

I'm dreaming in my bed
Another night without you
Your eyes they talk to me
Tell me what I got to do
Can't get it through my head
I'm hypnotized it's true
Everyday's a cool breeze
Because of you
