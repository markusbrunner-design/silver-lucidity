========================================================

This band is hot
It's on fire
Here at The Store
You get what you desire

At the door biker boys check your ID
Security they say but no police
The owner's making money
His hand's in every jar
We get paid cash
Open tab at the bar

Biker babes and all night parties
If I keep this up it's gonna kill me
Someone screamed Rock & Roll forever
We'll have to wait and see

Someone said
Oh man, what a life
You sing and dance
And get all those babes
Come and go
Ain't got no wife
You know you've got it made

How long will this last
Is this the dream I had
Living night to night
Just a band nomad
Grinding out these covers
In a vast wasteland
Should I give in
And be a face in a band
Alone on the edge
Doing the best I can
Feeling kinda lost
Like an Also Ran

Biker babes and all night parties
If I keep this up it's gonna kill me
Someone screamed Rock & Roll forever
We'll have to wait and see

Someone said
Oh man, what a life
You sing and dance
And get all those babes
Come and go
Ain't got no wife
You know you've got it made

Well they busted The Store
Padlocks and chains
Across the door
Undercover Rat and Narco Cop
Distribution with intent
Was the pop
That was fun
Now what
I need a plan
Oh, I am an Also Ran

Play the game
Then burnout and fade away
Play the game
Then burnout and fade away

Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
