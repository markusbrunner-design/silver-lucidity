========================================================

I'm finally comin' Home
I've been gone for quite a while
I think of you everyday now
In my mind I count the miles
Your love springs eternal
Cuts through the armor
Straight to my heart
I believe I need you beside me
Give up this life on the road
And make a new start

I'm dreaming in my bed
Another night without you
Your eyes they talk to me
Tell me what I got to do
Can't get it through my head
I'm hypnotized it's true
Everyday's a cool breeze
Because of you

I've searched high and low
With no luck
Trying to find an open door
Been lied to
By smiling faces
All they wanted
Was the next score
Since I met you
I see a real future
One that's not run
By lust and greed
I've worked so hard
To try and make it
Now I realize
You're all I need

I'm dreaming in my bed
Another night without you
Your eyes they talk to me
Tell me what I got to do
Can't get it through my head
I'm hypnotized it's true
Everyday's a cool breeze
Because of you
