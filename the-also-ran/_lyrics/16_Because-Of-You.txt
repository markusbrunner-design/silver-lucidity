Because of You Some where on the road 1986
1) I?m finally coming Home. I?ve been gone for quite a while. I think of you everyday now. In my mind I count the miles. Your love springs eternal. Cuts through the armor, straight to my heart. I believe I need you beside me. Give up this life on the road and make a new start.
C) I am dreaming in my bed. Another night without you. Your eyes they talk to me. Tell me what I got to do. Can?t get it through my head. I?m hypnotized it?s true. Everyday is a cool breeze because of you.
2) I?ve searched high and low with no luck. Trying to find an open door. Been lied to by smiling faces. All they wanted was the next score. Since I met you I see a real future. One that?s not run by lust and greed. I?ve worked so hard to try and make it. Now I realize you?re all I need.
Repeat C)
