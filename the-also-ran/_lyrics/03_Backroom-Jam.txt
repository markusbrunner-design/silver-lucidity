Backroom Jam Tempe, Arizona 1973-1974
1) There?s got to be more than what we are doing here. It stirs inside my soul. The shed is dark. The way is clear. We need to find a way to step right up. And somehow grow out of this shadow.
PC) We?ll reach out to every musician. Let them hear these words. We got a place with sound equipment. Hey you! Let your soul be heard. It?s time, play music come together. Why don?t you join us in the backroom. We got pizza and beer. And Rock & Roll. If you dare!
C) Come on down and bring your partner. If you play or just want to dance. It?s right here don?t look no further. Right here at the Backroom Jam. Sing and Play. Have a good time. Right here at the Backroom Jam.
2) That first big step started out slowly .No one showed up it was just the guys and me. On the Green, played guitars, at the University. The next thing you know. We?re celebrities.
Repeat PC)
Repeat C)
Jam!
