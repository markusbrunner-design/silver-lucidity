There's got to be more
Than what we are doing here
It stirs inside my soul
The shed is dark
The way is clear
We need to find a way
To step right up
And somehow grow out of this shadow

We'll reach out to every musician
Let them hear these words
We got a place with sound equipment
Hey you, let your soul be heard
It's time, play music come together
Why don't you join us in the backroom
We got pizza and beer and Rock & Roll
If you dare

Come on down and bring your partner
If you play or just want to dance
It's right here, don't look no further
Right here at the Backroom Jam
Sing and Play
Have a good time
Right here at the Backroom Jam

That first big step started out slowly
No one showed up it was just the guys and me
On the Greens, played guitars, at the university
The next thing you know
We're celebrities

We'll reach out to every musician
Let them hear these words
We got a place with sound equipment
Hey you, let your soul be heard
It's time, play music come together
Why don't you join us in the backroom
We got pizza and beer and Rock & Roll
If you dare

Come on down and bring your partner
If you play or just want to dance
It's right here, don't look no further
Right here at the Backroom Jam
Sing and Play
Have a good time
Right here at the Backroom Jam
