Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

We started out in a shed
Having big dreams of what's ahead
Local promo Local gigs
Thinking this is the life to live
Convinced that fame was in the air
Living on a song and a prayer

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

Out on the road we felt real proud
Party hard
We'll draw the crowd
No interest from the record scouts
Eventually the money ran out
Then our Manager let us down
We couldn't make it on our own

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran

The pop music world is like an ocean
Deep and dark
Perpetual motion
Small fish eaten
Ambitions broken
Many are called
Few are chosen

Dare to live your dreams they say
And they'll all come true one day
If you only need to believe you can
How do you explain the also ran
