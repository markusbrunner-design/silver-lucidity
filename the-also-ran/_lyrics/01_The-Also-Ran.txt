The Also Ran Theme song
C) Dare to live your dreams they say. Will they all come true one day? If you only need to believe you can. How do you explain the also ran?1) We started out in a shed. Having big dreams about what?s ahead. Local promo. Local gigs. Thinking this is the life to live. Convinced that fame was in the air. Living on a song and a prayer.
Repeat C)
2) Out on the road we felt real proud. Party hard. We?ll draw the crowd. No interest from the record scouts. Eventually the money ran out. Then our Manager let us down. We couldn?t make it on our own.
Repeat C)
Bridge) The pop music world is like an ocean. Deep and dark, perpetual motion. Small fish eaten. Ambitions broken. Many are called but few are chosen.
Repeat C)
