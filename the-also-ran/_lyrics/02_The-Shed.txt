The Shed
1) When I was 19. I was out on my own. I had no clue. Just floating in the vast unknown. Lived right above. The place that I worked. Washing dishes every night and sweeping up the dirt.
C) In the shed out back. Drinking beer and singing songs. Chord books in hand. They played guitar, I?d sing along. We talked about how cool it would be. To see yourself jamming on TV. In the shed out back. That?s where dreams were made. Making a living. On a stage.
2) Some players stayed, some left. I was sad to see them go. But we never stopped playing even when it was windy and cold. Finally found a drummer who could keep us in time. Add a bass and everything gets real tight.
Repeat C)
OUTRO) C?mon let?s jam all night. You play a song and I?ll sing along. DREAMS.
