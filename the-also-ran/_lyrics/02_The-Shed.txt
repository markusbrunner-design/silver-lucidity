When I was 19
I was out on my own
I had no clue
Just floating in the vast unknown
Lived right above
The place that I worked
Washing dishes every night
And sweeping up the dirt

In the shed out back
Drinking beer, singing songs
Chord books in hand
They played guitars, I'd sing along
We talked about how cool it would be
To see yourself jammin' on TV
In the shed out back
That's where dreams were made
Making a living on a stage

Some players stayed
Some left
I was sad to see them go
But we never stopped playing
Wven when it was windy and cold
Finally found a drummer who could
Keep us in time
Add a bass and
Everything gets real tight

In the shed out back
Drinking beer, singing songs
Chord books in hand
They played guitars, I'd sing along
We talked about how cool it would be
To see yourself jammin' on TV
In the shed out back
That's where dreams were made
Making a living on a stage

C'mon we'll jam all night
You play a song and
I'll sing along
Dreams
