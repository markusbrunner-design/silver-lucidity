========================================================

Sun goes down on the desert tonight
Pastel colors and fire fill the sky
Behind me the mighty Superstitions stand
Majestic, Eerie, Ohh
They do not lie
Here I stand on a stage on Main street
An old Western movie set and back lot
Tonight we'll open our next adventure
As we move forward
Hey this is our shot

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high

Can you feel it from the crowd
The lights and the sound
There's magic in the air
People jumping up and down
Smiling faces all around
It's a buzz that we share
Song after song
Beat after beat
Everybody dancing in the street
The mountains echo our vibe
Such a beautiful place to be
Everybody open and free
Even old spirits
From the Apache tribe

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high

There she stood right in front of me
Oh my god, who can this Goddess be
Blonde hair, blue eyes
Hair in a bandanna
I've got to meet this girl
They call Hannah

At the Lost Dutchman's Ranch
That's right
There's gold in them hills
So park your car and walk right in
This town will give you the chill
A General Store and the Saloon is open
Use Dutchman's Dollars to buy
There's no horses but there is a jail
So move to the music and fly high
