Lost Dutchman?s Ranch30 miles east of Mesa, Arizona 1975
1) Sun goes down on the desert tonight. Pastel colors and fire fill the sky. Behind me the mighty Superstitions stand. Majestic, Eerie, Ohh. They do not lie. Here I stand on a stage on Main street. An old Western movie set and back lot. Tonight we?ll open our next adventure. As we move forward, hey this is our shot.
C) At the Lost Dutchman?s Ranch, that?s right. There?s gold in them hills. So park your car and walk right in. This town will give you the chills. A General Store and the Saloon is open. Use Dutchman?s Dollars to buy. There?s no horses but there is a jail. So move to the music and fly high.
2) Can you feel it from the crowd. The lights and the sound. There?s magic in the air. People jumping up and down. Smiling faces all around. It?s a buzz that we share. Song after song. Beat after beat. Everybody dancing in the street. The mountains echo our vibe. Such a beautiful place to be. Everybody open and free. Even old spirits from the Apache tribe.

Bridge There She stood right in front of me. Oh my god. Who can this Goddess be. Blonde hair, blue eyes, hair in a bandanna. I?ve got to meet this girl they call Hannah.
