========================================================

London Bridge is fallin' down
Fallin' down
Fallin' down
London Bridge is fallin' down
Fallin' down
Sell it before it hits the ground

Feel the sun, ohh, smell the air
See the bridge rebuilt over there
I could walk to California 
With all the boats on the lake
A Birthday Party is why we’re here
So come one, come all
Let’s celebrate

Build the bridge and they will come
There’s no more work to be done
Build the bridge and they will come
Toes in the water havin' fun

Build the bridge and they will come
July 4th in the sun
Build the bridge and they will come
Two-hundred years the party’s on

Look around such a beautiful sight
Tanned bodies sway into the night
If we could stop and freeze time
This frozen frame would be mine
So many people escape their lives
As the sun goes down
Givin' way to a pale moon light

Glistening shadows
Moving madly
In the darkness
Behaving badly
In out, In out, In out

Build the bridge and they will come
There’s no more work to be done
Build the bridge and they will come
Toes in the water havin' fun

Build the bridge and they will come
July 4th in the sun
Build the bridge and they will come
Two-hundred years the party’s on
