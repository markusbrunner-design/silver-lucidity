========================================================

Lean and buff and oh so handsome
That look in his eyes
He’s got the answers
Clean and tight and oh so nice
When he decides to take you home tonight
Don’t get to attached, he’s not for sale
He’s an alpha male

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah
Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye

When he struts in
He’s dressed for action
All the girls
They feel the attraction
When he moves
He skates on ice
Glides right up
To his prey tonight
The wink in his eye
The perfect smile
Locked and loaded
He’s got his girl

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah
Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye

Oh no, what did you do
Your ego’s got the best of you
Lie and smile
At the same time
There’s one girl
That’s wise to your crime
You skimmed profits
That belong to her
She’s coming for you
That much is sure
You can’t run
You can’t hide
Cause Hannah’s got you
In her sights

Gavin is Greedy
He thought he was needy
Gavin so Greedy
And now you’re gone
You kiss the girls
To make them cry
You never stop
To wonder why
Gavin is Greedy
Then along came Hannah
Bye, Bye
Bye, Bye
