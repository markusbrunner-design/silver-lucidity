Hey you
Get in line
Don't stand there and talk
If you wanna get inside
Because it's time to rock
In The Library
You don't need no books
You just bring your student rage
We're gonna use it all
To get you out of your cage
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Come in and don't be shy
Here's the situation
Let go, have fun
It's higher education
In The Library
Dancin', drinkin' all night long
Here's the lesson learned
Watch out who you do
Because you just might get burned
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Something's just not right
There's a man with a gun over there
I'm on a break, sitting backstage
He smiles and says don't stare
I can't help but wonder out loud
Why, what's next, he nods and says
You gotta play the game
Then burnout and fade away

Yeah! Here I am set after set
Night after night
Is this my dream
Play the game
Get it right
In The Library
Do I tell the others what went down
Do they care about what I found
Is this the risk or am I
The also ran
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

So I told the boys and we all agreed
Safer for us to break down and leave
Not so fast
So you know
You still owe
In The Library

Now the rules of the game
Have been read
Much easier to play than be dead
Watch your back
Have some heart
Now you've learned your part
In The Library
In The Library
Learnin' in The Library

Is this the right way to go
Gonna play my part
Don't wanna be
Burned out and fade away
No also ran
The rules of the game
So here I am
In the Library
In the Library
Learnin' in the Library
So this is your dream
Not quite what it seems
Will you play
Play the game
Then burnout and fade away
Play the game
