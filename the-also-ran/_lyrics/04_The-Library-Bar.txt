B) Something?s just not right. There?s a man with a gun over there. I?m on a break, sitting backstage. He smiles and says don?t stare. I can?t help but wonder out loud. Why, what?s next, he nods and says. You gotta play the game. Then burnout and fade away.
3) Yeah! Here I am set after set. Night after night. Is this my dream. Play the game. Get it right. In The Library. Do I tell the others what went down. Do they care about what I found. Is this the risk or am I the also ran. In The Library. In The Library. Learning in The Library.
4) So I told the boys and we all agreed. Safer for us to break down and leave. Not so fast. So you know. You still owe! In The Library.
