There’s a girl I met
Her name is Naomi
She has issue’s
Nobody told me
She lives her life 
With the monkey on her back
I didn’t know 
Until I saw her tracks
Long dark hair, hazel eyes
She’s so pretty
It’s just a shame
Her heart is empty

They call her Stagger Lee
Walks in and smiles at me
She’s wearing shades in the dark
But there’s a hole in her heart
When you gonna get out of your funk
Stagger Lee
It’s time to give up the junk
Stagger Lee
Walk and talk and you’re alive
Stagger Lee
Can’t you see

When Naomi comes around
She’s cool, so calm
Cooks, cleans, sews
Just like a second Mom
But when Stagger Lee appears
You’re gonna hide your head
Cause her eyes crave
Like the undead
Veins full of the demon seed
She just stumbles and mumbles

They call her Stagger Lee
Walks in and smiles at me
She’s wearing shades in the dark
But there’s a hole in her heart
When you gonna get out of your funk
Stagger Lee
It’s time to give up the junk
Stagger Lee
Walk and talk and you’re alive
Stagger Lee
Can’t you see

Sweet Naomi
Sweet Naomi
Sweet Naomi
Stagger Lee
