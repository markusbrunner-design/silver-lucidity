========================================================

So you wanna be a rock and roll star
Sign with me and you'll go far

Sit right down and let me talk to you
I know what I wanna do
I wanna go into business with you
And we'll call it Stealer
I know some people, they own a few clubs
We'll tour it up and down the Coast
We'll make money and you'll make friends
You'll be a rock and roll star

Hey, Hey Hannah
The girl from Santa Ana
Who knows every cartel
Oh, west of Havana
You say we passed the test
And you would like to invest
Sweet, Sweet Hannah
Yeah, we really wanna

First you sign on the dotted line
Then we'll figure out the rest
You're gonna need a truck and a van
Good equipment will make you the best
Start in the South to get warmed up
Wait till Spring has sprung
Then boogie North to the promised land
Stop at every College town

Hey, Hey Hannah
The girl from Santa Ana
Who knows every cartel
Oh, west of Havana
You say we passed the test
And you would like to invest
Sweet, Sweet Hannah
Yeah, we really wanna

Hey, Hey Hannah
The girl from Santa Ana
Sweet, Sweet Hannah
Yeah, we really wanna
Nothing comes for free
We'll sign
Then we'll see
