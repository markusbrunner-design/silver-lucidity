Santa Ana Hannah
Intro) So you wanna be a rock and roll star. Sign with me and you?ll go far.
1) Sit right down and let me talk to you. I know what I want to do. I want to go into business with you. And we?ll call it Stealer. I know some people, they own a few clubs. We?ll tour it up and down the Coast. We?ll make money and you?ll make friends. You?ll be a rock and roll star.
C) Hey, Hey Hannah. The girl from Santa Ana. Who knows every cartel. Oh, west of Havana. You say we passed the test. And you would like to invest. Sweet, Sweet Hannah. Yeah, we really wanna.
2) First you sign on the dotted line. Then we?ll figure out the rest. You?re gonna need a truck and a van. Good equipment will make you the best. Start in the South to get warmed up. Wait till Spring has sprung. Then boogie North to the promised land. Stop at every College town.
Repeat C)
Outro) Hey, Hey Hannah. The girl from Santa Ana. Sweet, Sweet Hannah. Yeah, we really wanna. Nothing comes for free. We?ll sign. Then we?ll see.
