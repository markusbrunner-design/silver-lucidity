========================================================

Hey Girl, I'm a cowboy
Wrangle from town to town
I ride, yeah, drive them dogies
You know I get around
I'll play your favorite song
All night long
But in the mornin'
I'll be gone

Load in
Load out
Labor of love, what it's about
We're a band on the run
Jump up and shout
We'll give it all we got
Cause we're here to have fun
Come on, let's go
Grab your partner rock and roll
The party's just begun

Tell your friends don't be shy
I'm here to win your crown
I've got no place to stay
What do you say, let's get down
Every set, we'll wind it up
Turn it loose and let you spin
Forget about your sorrow
Live like there's no tomorrow

Load in
Load out
Labor of love, what it's about
We're a band on the run
Jump up and shout
We'll give it all we got
Cause we're here to have fun
Come on, let's go
Grab your partner rock and roll
The party's just begun

Be my Rodeo Queen at least tonight
Cause you know, I got to ride
Keep smilin', wavin' to your crowd
You've got nothin' to hide
Hey Cowgirl
It won't be long
Another Rodeo comes to town

Load in
Load out
Labor of love, what it's about
We're a band on the run
Jump up and shout
We'll give it all we got
Cause we're here to have fun
Come on, let's go
Grab your partner rock and roll
The party's just begun
