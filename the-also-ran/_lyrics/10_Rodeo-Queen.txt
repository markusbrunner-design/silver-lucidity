1 Hey Girl, I?m a cowboy. Wrangle from town to town. I ride Yeah, drive them dogies. You know I get around. I?ll play your favorite songs. All night long. But in the morning. I?ll be gone.
C Load in. Load out. Labor of love, what it?s about. We?re a band on the run. Jump up and shout. We?ll give it all we got. Cause we?re here to have fun. Come on, let?s go. Grab your partner rock and roll. The party?s just begun.
2 Tell your friends don?t be shy. I?m here to win your crown. I?ve got no place to stay. What do ya say, let?s get down. Every set we?ll wind it up. Turn it loose and let you spin. Forget about your sorrow. Live like there?s no tomorrow.
