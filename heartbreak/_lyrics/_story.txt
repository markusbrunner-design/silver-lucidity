Plot for Heartbreak Album 13 songs

Working Title: How Many Times Can A Heart Get Broken?

1) First heartbreak Very young. Hard at work so uses dating sites. Meets perfect girl
V2 intentionally continues the story from V1...
Was thinking this could be the first chapter in the story we imagined. After this song they lose sight of one another but get back together around song 7 and continue on down the road.

3) Materialistic girl?s point of view. He?s too needy, too naÃ¯ve, too clinging Not what she expected from Internet exchange No flash car/Platinum card


4) He?s heartbroken. Thinks he will never love again


5) He?s got used to life a single man. Washing machines have no secrets for him (more light-hearted song?)


6) Sees his best friend get married. He is best man, flower in lapel, holding the rings, feeling lonely


7) Best friend says ?you gotta get over this?


8) Best friend?s sister catches bouquet at wedding. Looks around and falls for best man. Female solo Who?s that guy?


9) Who?s that girl? She looked my way. A glance full of promise. Starts to believe in life as a couple again


10) Duet with new girl


11) Girl gets sick


12) Girl sings farewell song


13) How many times can a heart get broken before it dies?


=> I think without happy ending is more realistic, but we could give the world more enthusiastic waves and proove the positiveness - let's end it with a happy ending instead?
