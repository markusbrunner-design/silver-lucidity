lyric content: our protagonist
realises he can't die.
Everyone on his journey dies
one after the other and he still lives.
He thinks about what his task is to
do left to get back to infinity - to
the endless power. What is his task?
He's way more developed than all
people he has had the possibility to
know and be friends or lovers. But
what is his task - he can't find it...
Is it connected with his creator-spirit?
