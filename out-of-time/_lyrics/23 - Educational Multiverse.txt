[Eternal Spirit]

#################################

lyric content: the eternal spirit
sings about new galaxies and
planets to form. They have
different shades for learning.
Some are more to get to know
imperfection like mother earth.
Others are immatrial musical spheres.
Others are within matrial galaxies but
immatrial and helping or disturbing
the matrial spheres to learn how
influencing others changes a system.
