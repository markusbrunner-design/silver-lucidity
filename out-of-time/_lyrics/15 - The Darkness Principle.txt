[Dark Spirit]

#################################

lyric content: the dark spirit
sings about being a bad one.
He likes to bully the life
of humans on earth and thinks
it's important because they need
it. They want to be egoists and
hate each other. They don't want
to be a good group helping each
other and he is the one to help
them find their egos. So he thinks
he is the most important spirit on
earth.
