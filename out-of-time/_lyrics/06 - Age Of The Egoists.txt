[Mankind Spirit]

0:37 - 1:07
A stranger to the truth
A stranger to the past
Those feelings you once knew
Are really fading fast

The siren sings of dominance
The triumph of the self
I go you go we go ego
Leave our feelings on the shelf

1:37 - 2:07
A stranger to the past
A onetime wasted youth
I saved the best till last
A stranger to the truth

I heard this song before
It drowns in hollow laughter
I heard this song before
Before or maybe after

2:52 - 3:22
A stranger to the life
You really want to lead
A stranger to the love
The love that turns to greed

You heard this song before
Lost in faded childhood dreams
The silent voiceless solitude
Loneliness an endless stream

lyric content: Mankind evolved
as egoists, they do everything
for getting richer without
looking for others - they don't
care anymore for others bankers
are using other people to get
their own money grown, the normal
middle-class man has no chance to
get enough money to live his dreams
