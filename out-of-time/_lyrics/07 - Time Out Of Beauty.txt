[Protagonist]

0:45 - 0:56
Thirty thousand feet
No time since I?left the ground
White clouds like a carpet
Earthly chains unbound

0:56 - 1:07
Time to forget
Time to hide
Time to remember
Blue sky wide

1:08 - 1:19
I?found heaven
On a sunny coast
This heaven lasts
Two weeks at most

1:19 - 1:40
Take time out
Head for the coast
Take time out
Two weeks at most

1:41 - 1:52
Watch as the waves
Cover my life
Watch as the waves
Cover the earth

1:53 - 2:04
Live the life
Feel the heat
Eat the fruit
Bittersweet

2:04 - 2:15
Take time out
Head for the coast
Take time out
Two weeks at most

3:06
Take time out

lyric content: our protagonist
treats himself to some time off.
He is on holiday on a nice beach
in the caribbean or so. There he
relaxes in the sun and watches the
waves and the greatness of nature.
