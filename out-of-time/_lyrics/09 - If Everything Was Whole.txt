lyric content: our protagonist
walks through nature - flowers
and tall grass and let's his
hands flow through it.
He thinks about how the world
could be if everyone realizes
the beauty of the planet.
It's the contrast - this planet
is ideal, but it's ideal
to realize imperfection, too.
But this he wents through only
in his thoughts -
because he mainly thinks about
the good pieces in this world and
can't understand the one's
not developed enough to see it.
