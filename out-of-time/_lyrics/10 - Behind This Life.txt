[Earth Spirit]

The winds blow
Seven ways at once
There's a warm rain in your face

Solitary travellers
Seek the rainbow gold
Magnetic north is calling

Behind the cloud
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings

The sun appears
in a temporary way
Low in the sky then fades

Worshippers sail on by
Miracles unseen
Magnetic North is calling

Beyond this world
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings

As seasons die
The sky holds crimson hands
On this heaven below

Each rainbow folds
Each circle disappears
Magnetic North is calling

Behind this life
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings
