[Protagonist]

#################################

lyric content: our protagonist is
a real creator. he flies through
space and time and universes.
He stops by in another galaxy and
creates new cities lifes, animals
and nature with just his imagination
on this planet.
It's a bit like the creation of earth
in the holy bible. We follow his steps
of creation and his detailed "image
painting" of the new world.
