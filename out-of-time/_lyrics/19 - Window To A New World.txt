[Protagonist]

As I slip away
Breathing slows, pictures fade
A memory of you, once clear
Now losing its shape

Feeling warm, feeling safe
Finding bliss in this dream state
A memory of you, and the pain
Both dissipate

This little cure, a pinch is all that it takes
Seems overdue, floating and flying through space

It's all now in view
Tears made blurry, gone away
Once you were here
Maybe this is a place for me to stay

I pull against by chain
Cannot hide from this new pain
Don't think I know you
No sleep, there's no escape

Stuck to the floor
Pinch me, I want to awake
Death overdue
These tracks are all that remain

Days now, numbered few
When will my demons go away
When we meet again
Hope that I remember your face
