[Protagonist]

Looking up
Saw the birds fly by
Planes are taking leave
No clouds in a summer sky

Seems it's a sunny day in heaven
Time to play, stay in time
Seems it's a sunny day in heaven
Leaving poets forced to rhyme

Looking Down
Saw the names float by
Brushed away the fallen leaves
No doubts left behind

Seems it's a broken world we made here
No time for thought, no time for care
Always a sunny day in heaven
Shining on what isn't there
