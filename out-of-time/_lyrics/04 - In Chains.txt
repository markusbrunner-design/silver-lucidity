[Earth Spirit]

0:19 - 0:36
Pastel shades
Well-groomed lawns
Sunset smiles
Broken dawns

0:37 - 0:54
Perfect Kids
Perfect Wife
Raise the cup
Trophy Life

0:54 - 1:11 Chorus
Walk these streets
It's all for show
Material won't let you go
Build it up
Knock it down
Material rules this town

One big solo or 3 different solos:
1:12 - 1:29 - Verse Solos
1:30 - 1:46 - Verse Solos
1:47 - 2:04 - Chorus Solos

2:21 - 2:38
Then one day
Get in your car
Drive it fast
Take it far

2:39 - 2:56
All you see
All the same
On Video
In Game

2:57 - 3:13
Weather vanes
Are set for snow
Hidden chains won't let you go
Shake the world
Shake it down
Take your place
Take the crown

lyric content: it's about routine.
people are trapped in the expectations
of the poeple. You have to go to
college. You have to get a well paid
job. You have to build a house. You
have to plant a tree. You have to
get a beautiful wife and drive an
awesome car.
Our protagonist walks through the
streets and analyses all those
unhappy and stressed people.
He reads their minds and sees
all their expectations others
demand from them. They are all
"in chains".
