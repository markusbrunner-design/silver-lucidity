lyric content: the endless energy
(female vocalist)
thinks about perfection and
reunion of all souls. He sees
all those galaxies and parallel
universes and feels everyone within.
The endless power feels all those
greed and anger and is happy to get
to know this imperfection - knowing
that light is brigther when knowing
the darkness, too.
