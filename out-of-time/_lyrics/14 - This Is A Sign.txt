[Time Spirit]

Life opens up and swallows me whole
When I’m not looking
The world missed a turn
The floor underneath
It starts slipping
When did it happen
I didn’t notice when the song ended
The one chance I had
Was in the wind
It won’t return again
I’m in the wind
This is a sign

Look in the direction
Of all that’s been wanting
We’re already there
We all need a target
That we see from space
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign

It’s easy to get stuck in the red
When you forget
You get a choice
We’re in control
Caught up in the drama
Life can go on without it
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign

Where we shift our focus
That becomes real
Reject what’s not worthy
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
