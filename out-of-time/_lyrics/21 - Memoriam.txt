[Protagonist]

So now I'm getting old
The coward and the bold
All part of who I am
In memoriam

I throw away restraint
The gambler and the saint
All part of who I am
In memoriam

The innocents start
On their journeys of hope
With the sins of the world to guide them
The guilty make their peace

Think with this empty mind
Sighted yet still blind
All part of who I am
In memoriam

I'll draw this diagram
The liar and the lamb
All part of who I am
In memoriam

The innocents start
On their journeys of hope
With the sins of the world to guide them
The guilty make their peace
