[Time Spirit]

0:31 - 0:40
Here comes another one
Fresh faced
Race to run
Here comes another one
Say
Hello Son

1:10 - 1:19
Forward
Ever on
Life's work is never done
Can't Stop
Race to run
Chasing the midnight sun

1:28 - 1:47
Keep this whole thing running
Keep this future coming
Wheels forever turning
Fires forever burning

2:26 - 2:45
Keep the whole show on play
Closer and further away
Wheels forever turning
Points of no returning

3:05 - 3:14
Here comes another one
Fresh faced
Race to run
Here comes another one
Say
Hello Son

lyric content: The time spirit sings
about the time "machine"
that runs continuously the routine
without stopping - times go by
everything develops people die,
others are born
