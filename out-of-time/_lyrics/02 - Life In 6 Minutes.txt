I feel a beat
I sail a sea
I make a space
So safe inside your love

0:42
I feel a song
Your voice is heard
Throughout this world
So safe inside your love

0:55
I keep my word
I keep my world
Swim seven seas
So safe inside your love

1:09
I bide my time
Unfamiliar time
I sing new songs
So safe inside your love

2:44
Measured by the clock
The time draws near
Chemistry and charm
So safe inside my love

2:58
I take first breath
Under the sun
Hello World
So safe inside our love

lyric content: our protagonist
is about to be born. He grows
within the belly of his mother.
We get to know how he starts to
get to learn to use his senses
and gets to know more and more
of the outer world - still being
within this belly.
