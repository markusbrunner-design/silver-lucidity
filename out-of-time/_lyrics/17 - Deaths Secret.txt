lyric content: this one is
about death and rebirth.
Our protagonist visits graveyards
and sees all those sad people
not knowing that we are all one
and death is not the end.
He also walks by at park facilities
and sees the opposite - happy children
playing. It's the contrast of
power/life and standstill/death which
is unique to this life here on earth.
It's a challenge for mankind to realise
that death is like birth - a happy transition.
