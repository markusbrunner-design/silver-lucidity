[Protagonist]

0:24 - 0:36
Still life
Single Picture
Still life
In a frame

0:48 - 1:00
Colours run
Change the view
See the sun
Cobalt Blue

1:24 - 1:36
Picture fades
Torn apart
Sad parades
Lonely Hearts

1:36 - 1:48
All the time we waste
Down familiar paths
So much more to taste
Let go of this raft

2:36 - 2:48
Shed your skin
Cut the cord
Press escape
Or stick with fate

lyric content: our protagonist thinks
about mankind on earth. They are not
developed enough, yet. But he got to know
hist power and tried them.
Most of the people
haven't realised, yet, that they are
creators. Realising you can change your
life simply by imagination is not present
in their cognitive powers. That's what
they need to realise. They have problems
with their lifes, but surrender to their
fate without even trying.
