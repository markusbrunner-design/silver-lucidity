[Protagonist]

#################################

lyric content: our protagonist
is alone in nature. walking up
hills and along watercourses.
He enjoys the silence and freedom
within "mother nature". Realizing
how mankind can evolve if they
find their innerselves.
On some parts where he walks by when there
are less flowers he puts out his hands
and imagines flowers which then fastly
grow out of earth. He is a true creator.
