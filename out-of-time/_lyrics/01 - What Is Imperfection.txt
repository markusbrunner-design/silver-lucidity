[Endless Energy]

1:19
How can I describe this to you?
No matter, no matter now
No up, no now, no blue
A constant tide pulls me through

2:16
Eternities flash on and off
Each instant lasts forever
No down, no me, no you
Re-arranging unchanging views

3:47
Here comes the moment, the start
Here comes each zero, each heart
Start every clock, measure it all
Here comes the pride and the fall

4:31
Stardust turns dark into light
Awakens these cold satellites
Shifting and hermaphrodite
Stardust makes love through the night

5:16
Here comes betrayal and pain
Time and time, time and again
5:40
No clocks can unbreak these chains
Both different and one and the same

6:02
How can I describe all this to you?
No matter, no matter
No up, no now, no blue
A constant tide pulls me through

lyric content: the endless energy
didn't know what imperfection is.
The decision was to create some
dimensions within which an evolution
and imperfection is experiencable.
So a big bang was the starting point
of this creation. The endless energy
split up into new worlds into humans,
animals, nature and so on to experience
what life without imperfection is.
So all of us are a part of this endless
energy, but we now have the possibility
to see ourselves developing and getting
to know what selfishness, arrogance and
egoism is.
