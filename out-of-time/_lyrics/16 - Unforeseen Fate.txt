[Protagonist]

#################################

lyric content: our protagnist
walks through the roads at night
and sees someone shooting his wife
  (or just another woman if Jeff Bragg
  is not our main protagonist)
to death, but he doesn't want this
to happen so he puts up all his creator
powers and turns back the time, let's the
gun shot stand still and drop.
The attacker runs away - not believing
what just happens. But soon our protagonist
get's to know, that it wasn't his action
to take. Because a bus catches the attacked
person. It was just the time for him to die.
He soon realizes that everyone dies just
at the wanted timing. Everything happens
out of purpose - no matter how unbelievable
that might seem to be.
