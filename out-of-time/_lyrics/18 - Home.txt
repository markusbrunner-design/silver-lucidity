[Mankind Spirit]

The sky is fading black
Into a dark and terrifying night
There is a fear inside of me
That let's me shiver deep inside
Where is the light that guides
The way out of this unbearable pain
No one is there, I'm so alone
And I believe my end is here

Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back and let me
Hope to see the sun
Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back to my home

There is a light
But yet so far away
It seems to disappear
I keep on running, hopefully
I think to reach
Before it's gone

Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back and let me
Hope to see the sun
Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back to my home
