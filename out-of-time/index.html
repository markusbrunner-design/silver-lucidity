lyric content: the endless energy
didn't know what imperfection is.
The decision was to create some
dimensions within which an evolution
and imperfection is experiencable.
So a big bang was the starting point
of this creation. The endless energy
split up into new worlds into humans,
animals, nature and so on to experience
what life without imperfection is.
So all of us are a part of this endless
energy, but we now have the possibility
to see ourselves developing and getting
to know what selfishness, arrogance and
egoism is.

Looking up
Saw the birds fly by
Planes are taking leave
No clouds in a summer sky

Seems it's a sunny day in heaven
Time to play, stay in time
Seems it's a sunny day in heaven
Leaving poets forced to rhyme

Looking Down
Saw the names float by
Brushed away the fallen leaves
No doubts left behind

Seems it's a broken world we made here
No time for thought,  no time for care
Always a sunny day in heaven
Shining on what isn't there

The winds blow
Seven ways at once
There's a warm rain in your face

Solitary travellers
Seek the rainbow gold
Magnetic north is calling

Behind the cloud
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings

The sun appears
in a temporary way
Low in the sky then fades

Worshippers sail on by
Miracles unseen
Magnetic North is calling

Beyond this world
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings

As seasons die
The sky holds crimson hands
On this heaven below

Each rainbow folds
Each circle disappears
Magnetic North is calling

Behind this life
There's another, and another, and another after that
Before my eyes
The darkness sings

All part of who I am

On their journeys of hope
With the sins of the world to guide them
The guilty make their peace

Think with this empty mind
Sighted yet still blind
All part of who I am

I'll draw this diagram
The liar and the lamb
All part of who I am

the endless power. What is his task?
He's way more developed than all
people he has had the possibility to
know and be friends or lovers. But
what is his task - he can't find it...
What if it is to realise: just to live
in the moment with the best of thoughts
and creator-spirit and don't think
too much about what could be or should be?
We have all to realise that we can not change others.
But we can always change ourselves - which indeed
can change others!

song follows after "Death's Secret (former: Surrender)" - it's the mankind spirit who sings it:

[Mankind Spirit]
The sky is fading black
Into a dark and terrifying night
There is a fear inside of me
That let's me shiver deep inside
Where is the light that guides
The way out of this unbearable pain
No one is there, I'm so alone
And I believe my end is here

Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back and let me
Hope to see the sun
Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back to my home

There is a light
But yet so far away
It seems to disappear
I keep on running, hopefully
I think to reach
Before it's gone

Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back and let me
Hope to see the sun
Let me see
Let me feel
Show me the way back to my home

song follows after "In Chains (former: Spent the day dreaming)" - it's the time spirit

[Time Spirit]
Life opens up and swallows me whole
When I’m not looking
The world missed a turn
The floor underneath
It starts slipping
When did it happen
I didn’t notice when the song ended
The one chance I had
Was in the wind
It won’t return again
I’m in the wind
This is a sign

Look in the direction
Of all that’s been wanting
We’re already there
We all need a target
That we see from space
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign

It’s easy to get stuck in the red
When you forget
You get a choice
We’re in control
Caught up in the drama
Life can go on without it
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign

Where we shift our focus
That becomes real
Reject what’s not worthy
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign
This is a sign

lyric content: it's all about
friendship. Our protagonist
has good times with them.
They drive up Route 66 in
a fast car. They ride over the
waves with their surf-boards.
They jump out of helicopters
with parachutes and so on.
A lot of adrenaline and relaxing fun.

lyric content: our protagnist
walks through the roads at night
and sees someone shooting another one
to death, but he doesn't want this
to happen so he puts up all his creator
powers and turns back the time, let's the
gun shot stand still and drop.
The attacker runs away - not believing
what just happens. But soon our protagonist
get's to know, that it wasn't his action
to take. Because a bus catches the attacked
person. It was just the time for him to die.
He soon realizes that everyone dies just
at the wanted timing. Everything happens
out of purpose - no matter how unbelievable
that might seem to be.

lyric content: the eternal spirit
sings about new galaxies and
planets to form. They have
different shades for learning.
Some are more to get to know
imperfection like mother earth.
Others are immatrial musical spheres.
Others are within matrial galaxies but
immatrial and helping or disturbing
the matrial spheres to learn how
influencing others changes a system.

sings about being a bad one.
He likes to bully the life
of humans on earth and thinks
it's important because they need
it. They want to be egoists and
hate each other. They don't want
to be a good group helping each
other and he is the one to help
them find their egos. So he thinks
he is the most important spirit on
earth.

As I slip away
Breathing slows, pictures fade
A memory of you, once clear
Now losing its shape

Feeling warm, feeling safe
Finding bliss in this dream state
A memory of you, and the pain
Both dissipate

This little cure, a pinch is all that it takes
Seems overdue, floating and flying through space

It's all now in view
Tears made blurry, gone away
Once you were here
Maybe this is a place for me to stay

I pull against by chain
Cannot hide from this new pain
Don't think I know you
No sleep, there's no escape

Stuck to the floor
Pinch me, I want to awake
Death overdue
These tracks are all that remain

Days now, numbered few
When will my demons go away
When we meet again
Hope that I remember your face
