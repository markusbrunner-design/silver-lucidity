The concept of linear time is only recent in our thinking
since we started to count the years and the relentless ticking clock
We measured time and therefore, we defined time
But there are no straight lines in the natural world

Our: World, Moon, Sun, and Seasons are all circular
Across the globe ancient cultures
Roman, Greek, Mayan, Egyptian, native American,
aboriginal Australian, Hindu, Buddhist
all believed in circular and parallel time

Does the ticking of time, then,
Define what time is, or is there more to it

What would you do if you could change time
Even if it changed your very being

This is a story of one man’s quest to alter time’s events
believing there is no better time than the alternative present
But in doing so, has he lost a world, that held everything
that was dear to him

He surfs on the ripples of time and
He plunges to the past
He hopes he can change the tomorrow
But will his hopes last

Verse I
In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test the newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt

Verse II
In that test there's just one question
Which you better not get wrong
If you fail to answer, darling
Say goodbye, you're out and gone

Chorus
And that question goes as follows
Listen well and please be quick
You have little time to answer
While you hear the time clock ticks
If you'd met with baby Hitler
Knowing what his future'd be
Would you kill the little fucker
Or would you just set him free

Verse III
No one knows who wrote that poser
But there is no doubt in me
He was one shit crazy little bustard
And as smart as one can be

Verse IV
There's a reason why I'm saying
That this riddle is so tough
Is because that once you've solved it
They release you from their draft

Chorus
Cause you see my friend there's really
No solution to this quiz
You can't kill the baby Hitler
Yet you must not let him live
Hell, the only thing you should say
When the choices are proposed
To this question I won't answer
Both these options I oppose

Bridge
It's this kind of situation
In which one could never win
Kill the baby really means that
You can't kill him to begin
If you kill that seed of evil
Time continuum will cease
Since you'd never kill that baby
Have he not done what he did

Chorus
And that question goes as follows
Listen well and please be quick
You have little time to answer
While you hear the time clock ticks
If you'd met with baby Hitler
Knowing what his future'd be
Would you kill the little fucker
Or would you just set him free

Verse V
And that thing just makes me crazy
All that time loop paradox
If one can't change past for better
Travel time is but a hoax

Ending Chorus
In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test all newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt
In that test there's just one question
Which I answered right headlong
I became a Traveling agent
How I wish that I'd got it wrong

Verse I
Early morning, a cup of tea
Sunny skies I still can't see
My Life's all packed in a cardboard box
A total shock and no hallway talks

Verse II
All around me long-faced friends
We all share the same bitter end
Good hard workers that can barely stand
Been hammered down to no amend

Chorus
And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
If you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
But I wake in fear each night
Every day I die

Verse III
All those human working bees
All these cubic office hives
Everyone just say I should
Take it calm, that I'll survive

Bridge
But I really followed through
And I know what fate devise
Grasping air, that's all I do
While I wait the long cold dive

Chorus
And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
When you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
Breaking into tears each night
Every day I die

Ending Chorus
As the sun is setting fast
Spreading darkness veil
I can't find escaping route
From these depths of hell
Maybe I just played it wrong
Don't know how or why
I will never end up dead
Every day I die

Verse 1
I will bend the arc of time
Fold it in and make it mine
I will build a time machine
With tech that is pure
And in pristine
I'll control the flow
Of time itself
It will bow to me
And yield
Everybody wants to rule their world

Chorus 1
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
Everybody wants the time to stop
And freeze

Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world

Verse 2
I will make myself
A time machine
I will plan it
And create
I will surf the mighty waves
Of time
I will surf the tides
Of fate

Chorus 2
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
Everybody knows the time won't heal
A thing
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world

Bridge
All the secrets
I was sworn to keep
I must blurt out
And reveal
All the blueprints
I must bluntly snitch
All the prototypes I'll steal

Outro
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Not yet told
Oh not yet told
Everybody fears the pains the time
Will bring
Everybody wants to change their world
To rule the world
To change their world
To rule the world
To change their world
To rule the world

Intro
Time after time
You said that I'm
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Time time time time

Verse I
You were never a believer
In my scientists' affairs
And you always said I'd never
Be someone or ever go somewhere

Verse II
You have always looked so worried
You have always seemed so scared
You have always been so horrid
Warned me from my harsh and bitter end

Chorus
Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Verse III
Please don't say that I am reckless
Please don't tell me it's a crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Taking all these moments, wasting time

Verse IV
I won't say that I'm not worried
I won't say I'm not afraid
I won't sell you bedtime stories
Life don't always has a happy end

Chorus
Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Bridge
I don't care for fancy places
They are such a waste of time
One can not serve only aces
One must make himself a little time
One must make himself
A little time

Verse V
Please don't say that I am selfish
It's my perfect little crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Making all these moments truly mine

Chorus
Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Verse I
Our world is full of conflicts
Our world is filled with hate
I once thought we could mend it
I fear we are too late

Verse II
I fear there is no future
For humankind on Earth
I hope we'll find salvation
Somewhere in outer space

Chorus
I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so deep
I hope you'll understand why
You will not join my trip

Verse III
I'm writing down these words while
I'm on the launching pad
The time all swirls around me
But I am not that scared

Chorus
I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so much
I hope you'll understand why
You're not aboard thIs launch

Bridge
I know some will say that leaving
Is but a cowardly act
That staying is believing
That brave men do whatever it takes
I surely hope that someone
Will find this manifest
I hope you will forgive me
I really tried my best

Chorus
I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I hope a day will come when
You'll read and understand
I hope the time will heal you
That the time will make amends

Intro
We escape to the sand dunes
To build out our dreams

Verse 1
Far from all the hustle
Far from all the fuss
We trust on a better future
By changing events locked in the past

Chorus
Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the past
So let it slip through our hands

Verse 2
In the farthest southern sun
Darkness never comes down
It’s the longest days
As we sit around
Waiting for the light to turn

Chorus
Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the  past
So let it slowly pass us

Verse 3
The endless summer sunshine
Powers the dream machine
Fully loaded at the solstice peak
At the time stop ticks
On the solar eclipse

Outro Chorus
In the distant horizon
A dark silhouette appears
His white haired head
Halo'ed in the sun’s reflection
It draws towards our direction

Section 1
Mr White knows he's right
He has to intervene
Ha cannot let chase your dream
You cannot have your time machine
You can't control flow of time
He has to hold the history line

Section 2
You cannot change the past
You cannot make the first the last

Section 3
There is an order to the universe
And the order will be his
Mr White knows he's right
To intervene before your flight

Section 4
This time daemon
Will be scheming
To control all your dreaming
He can't exist
If you persist
On changing the time events

Section 5
What is here now can only be
From what the past has sent

Section 6
He takes delight without reveal his

A - dversable

B - oundaries
I - mmersed

 - Machine

Section 7
Out of the dessert he comes
From his time and his space he roams
He has no home but for you
He has a RABBIiT hole

Verse I
If you have a dream
If you have a goal
You can come with me
To the rabbit hole
If you want to learn
And to know it all
Then you better crawl
Down the rabbit hole

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me
Through the rabbit hole

Verse II
Come and take my hand
Careful you might roll
All the way deep down
Down the rabbit hole
Let me guide you through
I won't let you fall
I won't let you leave
You can beg and crawl

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me
Through the rabbit hole

Bridge
I won't charge you much
For this trip my doll
Maybe just your life
Maybe just your soul
It's not much to pay
It's not much at all
For a ride with me
Through the rabbit hole

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me

Verse I
It was 2025
I was traveling alone
Took the long ride out of town
Far from you
And far from home

Verse II
Like a superhero dressed
All in crimson and indigo
I was scanning with my eyes
Everything that passed my window

Chorus
I was stunned from the world
That I saw through my window
All so old yet so new
So I had just to see more
All the hustle and the fuss
Passing outside my window
At the end
I got lost
In the cold urban limbo

Verse III
With acoustic old guitar
Walked the streets in endless roam
Searched for a guiding star
Under darkest skies of storm

Verse IV
Since I had no single clue
How to speak the local lingo
I was bound to be outcast
Like a traveling nomad weirdo

Chorus
All the luxury shops
All the fancy stretched limos
Full of magic and charm
But I just wished to be home
All the hustle and the fuss
All the lightbulbs' lit windows
I got lost
I was lost
In the cold urban limbo

Bridge
On the streets we're all the same
Nameless faces with no aim
Playing in this ruthless game
Honor free discharged of shame
I went thirty years ago
Yet I feel like moments passed
Since that day in which my dream
Shattered like a window's glass

Chorus
All my hopes and my dreams
Like a smashed broken window
All the things I have longed
I just wished to go back home
To the future I lost
To my lost loved grass widow
I got lost
I'm so lost
In this odd time trip limbo

Outro
So I started to walk
Marched alone to the unknown
I was lost
Now I found
Found a way to get back home

Verse I
I remember being told
Time is cradle of the world
How it all began with blast
How we're all but cosmic dust

Verse II
I remember me and mom
And vacations in the farm
I remember me and dad
Building castles in the sand

Chorus
I remember Truly do
How I set my eyes on you
Wrapped in childish
Scarf and gloves
And 20 seconds later
It was love

Verse III
I remember you and me
Swimming naked in the sea
I remember pushes, shoves
When we danced in all those clubs

Verse IV
Yes I vividly recalls
Sunny summers windy falls
Having fun just all the same
When the cold cold winters came

Bridge
I remember long ago
Smoking chimneys, misty glow
Chilly nights and falling snow
And a sprig of mistletoe
I remember frosty hoar
How you opened up the door
And your father earnest stare
As I walked with you up stairs

Chorus
I remember to this day
How you asked if I could stay
How you set my heart on flames
How I knew you felt the same
And 20 seconds later
We made love

Chorus
I remember to this day
How you begged of me to stay
How I said I won't be long
How I switched those switches on
And 20 seconds later
I was gone

20 decades Part us

Verse I
And sometimes as I walk along
These streets that near your childhood home
I think of all those times we spent
Those days and endless nights we had

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Verse II
And once again I get the thrills
Remembering how I used to feel
When we were kids and when we roamed
The town that was our world wide home

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Bridge
And sometimes when I think of us
The time we've missed the years that passed
I know that what we had is gone
I fear to be forever lone

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Verse I
Every single day is an enigma
Never knowing how it's going to end
Every day I fight away my fears and
Every day I try to make amends
Every single man could be a rival
Every single malt's my only friend
Every single moment makes me wonder
Will it be the last I'll get to spend

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Verse III
Every single day I keep believing
That order lies within the mess
Every single lie I keep believe in
Truly makes it harder to confess

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Bridge
Every single day that I am breathing
Leaving trails of rubbles and distress
Every single day the grin is grimmer
On the reapers face, I'm cheating death
Every single day is a dilemma
Every single day is one more test
Every single day I fear the reaper
Reach me, catch me, cut me to the chase

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Verse I
Heavy rain
Comes again
It's pouring long and hard
The rain just never seems to stall
Just keeps to fall

Verse II
And the winds
Storming up
The ground is almost gone
The rain just never stops at all
Just keeps to fall

Pre Chorus
Now it's just too late
Destiny is set
There is no turning back
From all the networks' fake

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Verse III
We all knew
We must pay
For all the wrongs we've done
The fire never seems to stop
It won't calm down

Pre Chorus
Now it is too late
Destiny is set
No one can make a mend
We're heading to the end

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Bridge
Now it's just too late
We lost all our faith
Our world is crushing down
We've burned it to the ground

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Verse I
So many things
I wish to say
But you are far
So far away
To endless hush
I'm doomed, my dear
My words could never
Reach your ears

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no heart
It took my soul
And ripped apart
The time is evil
cruel and fell
It didn't treat us
All that well

Verse II
My unsaid words
That have no sound
Are like an airbag
In my lungs
The boots of time
Will crush them down
The time Surrenders
To no one

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

Bridge
The time is using
Loaded dice
It's playing catch
With us as mice
Like unseen trees
Though high and tall
No one can hear us
Once we fall

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

Outro
The time will hit
And hurt you bad
It will not stop
Until you're dead

Verse I
It never rains in outer space
The winds won't bring you scents of summer
You cannot tell a night from a day
You cannot tell one from the other

Verse II
The outer space is cold and dark
It has no borders and no structure
The outer space is like my soul
It's hollowed out for ever after

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you endless powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Verse III
Outside of time is where I roamed
To new frontiers away from Earth
I tried to find my way back home
But couldn't even find my breath

Verse IV
Outside of time is where I went
I searched a home a nesting shelter
I only found an endless void
A world all ruptured, a disaster

Bridge
Yes all I found was endless void
Infinity of empty darkness
Infinity of pain and grief
Yes all I found was endless suffering

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Verse I
Will I ever get to feel
While my heart is beating still
And my blood not yet been chilled
One more love, one new thrill

Verse II
Will I ever get to see
How my children grow to be
Blooming branches in my tree
Bearing fruits of family

Chorus
No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

Verse III
Will I ever stop to fear
Losing all I hold so dear
Could I cease from shedding tears
Knowing that the end is near

Verse IV
If I'll ever get to Choose
I would rather die than lose
All the Memories I have
All the moments I have saved

Chorus
No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

Bridge
Life is short
That's what people say
You must live it strong
Each and every day
No one has been told
What the future holds
No one has been told
No one has been told

Chorus
No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

Chorus
No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming

Verse I
If I could look at the future
What would I see
Would It be joy and laughter
Or only death and debris

Pre Chorus
The time is my bitter rival
The time is my foe
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never slows

Chorus
I've surfed on the ripples of time and
I've plunge to the past
I hoped I could change the tomorrow
But my hopes didn't last
I know now there isn't a future
In which we'll both get to live
I know there is no point in dreaming
But still, I believe

Verse II
If I could see the tomorrow
What would I see
Would it be grief and sorrow
Or would it be glee

Bridge
I've surfed on the waves of the time and
I've plunged in the past
I hoped I could change the future
I tried, but alas
I know now there's no real tomorrow
In which I'll meet you again
I feel there is no point in living
While I'm drowning in pains

Pre Chorus
The time is my bitter rival
The time's not my friend
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never bends

Chorus
I've surfed on the surges of the time and
I got lost in the past
I hope that my bottle will reach you
That my message gets passed
I know that there is no real reason
To hope you'll ever forgive
I know that there's no point in hoping
But still, I believe

Verse 1
Some days are brighter days
And some the darkness will fall
Some days are longer days
Some never happened at all

Chorus
And I think of you
I hear your voice
And it warms me up
But I know
I have no choice
But to carry on

Verse 2
I chased all my dreams
Down a rabbit hole
And woke up somewhere
Out of time
Floating and alone

Verse 3
No one knows what's coming now
No one has been told
I just know you're not around
And I'm so lonely and cold

Verse 4
Time is such a bitter bitch
She is such a foe
She is mean and has no heart
She took away my soul

Chorus
And I think of you
I see your face
And it warms me up
But I know it's all too much
But I can't stop
Missing you, missing us

Bridge
And time, oh after time
I was wasting time
Warned out of my harsh
And bitter end
Now it's just too late
Our destiny is set
And there is no turning back
For us no more

Outro Verse
Time is no one's slave
She will never bend
Time is not my friend
She's just my endless end
When every day I die
