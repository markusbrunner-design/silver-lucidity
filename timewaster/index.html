        <pre class="lyrics">
The concept of linear time is only recent in our thinking
Since we started to count the years and the relentless ticking clock
We measured time and therefore, we defined time
But there are no straight lines in the natural world

Our World, Moon, Sun, and Seasons are all circular
Across the globe ancient cultures
Roman, Greek, Mayan, Egyptian, native American
Aboriginal Australian, Hindu, Buddhist
All believed in circular and parallel time

Does the ticking of time, then
Define what time is, or is there more to it

What would you do if you could change time
Even if it changed your very being

This is a story of one man’s quest to alter time’s events
Believing there is no better time than the alternative present
But in doing so, has he lost a world, that held everything
That was dear to him

He surfs on the ripples of time
And he plunges to the past
He hopes he can change the tomorrow
But will his hopes last

In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test the newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt

In that test there's just one question
Which you better not get wrong
If you fail to answer, darling
Say goodbye, you're out and gone

And that question goes as follows
Listen well and please be quick
You have little time to answer
While you hear the time clock ticks
If you'd met with baby Hitler
Knowing what his future would be
Would you kill the little fucker
Or would you just set him free

No one knows who wrote that poser
But there is no doubt in me
He was one shit crazy little bastard
And as smart as one can be

There's a reason why I'm saying
That this riddle is so tough
Is because that once you've solved it
They release you from their draft

Cause you see my friend there's really
No solution to this quiz
You can't kill the baby Hitler
Yet you must not let him live
Hell, the only thing you should say
When the choices are proposed
To this question I won't answer
Both these options I oppose

It's this kind of situation
In which one could never win
Kill the baby really means that
You can't kill him to begin
If you kill that seed of evil
Time continuum will cease
Since you'd never kill that baby
Have he not done what he did

And that thing just makes me crazy
All that time loop paradox
If one can't change past for better
Travel time is but a hoax

In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test all newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt
In that test there's just one question
Which I answered right headlong
I became a Traveling agent
How I wish that I'd got it wrong
How I wish that I'd got it wrong

Early morning, a cup of tea
Sunny skies I can not see
Life all packed in a cardboard box
A total shock, no hallway talks

All around me long-faced friends
We all share the same bitter end
Good hard workers that can barely stand
Hammered down to no amend

And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
If you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
But I wake in fear each night
Every day I die

All those human working bees
All these cubic office hives
Everyone just says I should
Take it calm, that I'll survive

But I really followed through
And I know what fate devise
Grasping air, that's all I do
While I wait the long cold dive

And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
When you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
Breaking into tears each night
Every day I die

As the sun is setting fast
Spreading darkness veil
I can't find an escaping route
From these depths of hell
Maybe I just played it wrong
Don't know how or why
I will never end up dead
It's: Every day I die

I will bend the arc of time
Fold it in and make it mine
I will build a time machine
With tech that is pure
And in pristine
I'll control the flow
Of time itself
It will bow to me
And yield
Everybody wants to rule their world

Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
And Everybody wants the time
To stop and freeze

Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
To change our world

I will make myself
A time machine
I will plan it
And create
I will surf the mighty waves
Of time
I will surf the tides
Of fate

And everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
Everybody knows the time won't heal
A thing

And everybody wants to change our world
Everybody wants to change our world
Everybody wants to change our world
Change our world

All the secrets
I was sworn to keep
I must blurt out
And reveal
All the blueprints
I must bluntly snitch
All the prototypes
I'll steal

And everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write the story
Long been told
Or not yet told
And everybody fears the pains the time
Will bring
And everybody wants to change our world

To change our world
To rule our world

Time after time
You said that I'm
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Time time time time

You were never a believer
In my scientists' affairs
And you always said I'd never
Be someone or ever go somewhere

You have always looked so worried
You have always seemed so scared
You have always been so horrid
Warned me from my harsh and bitter end

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Please don't say that I am reckless
Please don't tell me it's a crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Taking all these moments, wasting time

I won't say that I'm not worried
I won't say I'm not afraid
I won't sell you bedtime stories
Life don't always has a happy end

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

I don't care for fancy places
They are such a waste of time
One can not serve only aces
One must make himself a little time
One must make himself
A little time

Please don't say that I am selfish
It's my perfect little crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Making all these moments truly mine

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Our world is full of conflicts
Our world is filled with hate
I once thought we could mend it
I fear we are too late

I fear there is no future
For humankind on Earth
I hope we'll find salvation
Somewhere in outer space

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so deep
I hope you'll understand why
You will not join my trip

I'm writing down these words while
I'm on the launching pad
The time all swirls around me
But I am not that scared

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so much
I hope you'll understand why
You're not aboard thIs launch

I know some will say that leaving
Is but a cowardly act
That staying is believing
That brave men do whatever it takes
I surely hope that someone
Will find this manifest
I hope you will forgive me
I really tried my best

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I hope a day will come when
You'll read and understand
I hope the time will heal you

We escape to the sand dunes
To build out our dreams

Far from all the hustle
Far from all the fuss
We trust on a better future
By changing events locked in the past

Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the past
So let it slip through our hands

In the farthest southern sun
Darkness never comes down
It’s the longest days
As we sit around
Waiting for the light to turn

Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the  past
So let it slowly pass us

The endless summer sunshine
Powers the dream machine
Fully loaded at the solstice peak
At the time stop ticks
On the solar eclipse

In the distant horizon
A dark silhouette appears
His white haired head
Halo'ed in the sun’s reflection
It draws towards our direction

Mr White knows he's right

You cannot change the past
You cannot make the first the last

There is an order to the universe
And the order will be his
Mr White knows he's right
To intervene before your flight

This time daemon
Will be scheming
To control all your dreaming
He can't exist
If you persist
On changing the time events

What is here now can only be
From what the past has sent

He takes delight without reveal his

It was 2025
I was traveling alone
Took the long ride out of town
Far from you
And far from home

Like a superhero dressed
All in crimson and indigo
I was scanning with my eyes
Everything that passed my window

I was stunned from the world
That I saw through my window
All so old yet so new
So I had just to see more
All the hustle and the fuss
Passing outside my window
At the end
I got lost
In the cold urban limbo

With acoustic old guitar
Walked the streets in endless roam
Searched for a guiding star
Under darkest skies of storm

Since I had no single clue
How to speak the local lingo
I was bound to be outcast
Like a traveling nomad weirdo

All the luxury shops
All the fancy stretched limos
Full of magic and charm
But I just wished to be home
All the hustle and the fuss
All the lightbulbs' lit windows
I got lost
I was lost
In the cold urban limbo

On the streets we're all the same
Nameless faces with no aim
Playing in this ruthless game
Honor free discharged of shame
I went thirty years ago
Yet I feel like moments passed
Since that day in which my dream
Shattered like a window's glass

All my hopes and my dreams
Like a smashed broken window
All the things I have longed
I just wished to go back home
To the future I lost
To my lost loved grass widow
I got lost
I'm so lost
In this odd time trip limbo

So I started to walk
Marched alone to the unknown
I was lost
Now I found
Found a way to get back home

I remember being told
Time is cradle of the world
How it all began with blast
How we're all but cosmic dust

I remember me and mom
And vacations in the farm
I remember me and dad
Building castles in the sand

I remember Truly do
How I set my eyes on you
Wrapped in childish
Scarf and gloves
And 20 seconds later
It was love

I remember you and me
Swimming naked in the sea
I remember pushes, shoves
When we danced in all those clubs

Yes I vividly recalls
Sunny summers windy falls
Having fun just all the same
When the cold cold winters came

I remember long ago
Smoking chimneys, misty glow
Chilly nights and falling snow
And a sprig of mistletoe
I remember frosty hoar
How you opened up the door
And your father earnest stare
As I walked with you up stairs

I remember to this day
How you asked if I could stay
How you set my heart on flames
How I knew you felt the same
And 20 seconds later
We made love

I remember to this day
How you begged of me to stay
How I said I won't be long
How I switched those switches on
And 20 seconds later
I was gone

20 decades Part us
Time goes on

And sometimes as I walk along
These streets that near your childhood home
I think of all those times we spent
Those days and endless nights we had

I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

And once again I get the thrills
Remembering how I used to feel
When we were kids and when we roamed
The town that was our world wide home

I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

And sometimes when I think of us
The time we've missed the years that passed
I know that what we had is gone
I fear to be forever lone

I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Every single day is an enigma
Never knowing how it's going to end
Every day I fight away my fears and
Every day I try to make amends
Every single man could be a rival
Every single malt's my only friend
Every single moment makes me wonder
Will it be the last I'll get to spend

Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Every single day I keep believing
That order lies within the mess
Every single lie I keep believe in
Truly makes it harder to confess

Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Every single day that I am breathing
Leaving trails of rubbles and distress
Every single day the grin is grimmer
On the reapers face, I'm cheating death
Every single day is a dilemma
Every single day is one more test
Every single day I fear the reaper
Reach me, catch me, cut me to the chase

Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Heavy rain
Comes again
It's pouring long and hard
The rain just never seems to stall
Just keeps to fall

And the winds
Storming up
The ground is almost gone
The rain just never stops at all
Just keeps to fall

Now it's just too late
Destiny is set
There is no turning back
From all the networks' fake

We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

We all knew
We must pay
For all the wrongs we've done
The fire never seems to stop
It won't calm down

Now it is too late
Destiny is set
No one can make a mend
We're heading to the end

We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Now it's just too late
We lost all our faith
Our world is crushing down
We've burned it to the ground

We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

So many things
I wish to say
But you are far
So far away
To endless hush
I'm doomed, my dear
My words could never
Reach your ears

The time is mean
It has no heart
It took my soul
And ripped apart
The time is evil
cruel and fell
It didn't treat us
All that well

My unsaid words
That have no sound
Are like an airbag
In my lungs
The boots of time
Will crush them down
The time Surrenders
To no one

The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

The time is using
Loaded dice
It's playing catch
With us as mice
Like unseen trees
Though high and tall
No one can hear us
Once we fall

The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

The time will hit
And hurt you bad
It will not stop
Until you're dead

It never rains in outer space
The winds won't bring you scents of summer
You cannot tell a night from a day
You cannot tell one from the other

The outer space is cold and dark
It has no borders and no structure
The outer space is like my soul
It's hollowed out for ever after

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you endless powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Outside of time is where I roamed
To new frontiers away from Earth
I tried to find my way back home
But couldn't even find my breath

Outside of time is where I went
I searched a home a nesting shelter
I only found an endless void
A world all ruptured, a disaster

Yes all I found was endless void
Infinity of empty darkness
Infinity of pain and grief
Yes all I found was endless suffering

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Will I ever get to feel
While my heart is beating still
And my blood not yet been chilled
One more love, one new thrill

Will I ever get to see
How my children grow to be
Blooming branches in my tree
Bearing fruits of family

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

Will I ever stop to fear
Losing all I hold so dear
Could I cease from shedding tears
Knowing that the end is near

If I'll ever get to Choose
I would rather die than lose
All the Memories I have
All the moments I have saved

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

Life is short
That's what people say
You must live it strong
Each and every day
No one has been told
What the future holds
No one has been told
No one has been told

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
No one has been told

If I could look at the future
What would I see
Would It be joy and laughter
Or only death and debris

The time is my bitter rival
The time is my foe
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never slows

I've surfed on the ripples of time and
I've plunge to the past
I hoped I could change the tomorrow
But my hopes didn't last
I know now there isn't a future
In which we'll both get to live
I know there is no point in dreaming
But still, I believe

If I could see the tomorrow
What would I see
Would it be grief and sorrow
Or would it be glee

I've surfed on the waves of the time and
I've plunged in the past
I hoped I could change the future
I tried, but alas
I know now there's no real tomorrow
In which I'll meet you again
I feel there is no point in living
While I'm drowning in pains

The time is my bitter rival
The time's not my friend
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never bends

I've surfed on the surges of the time and
I got lost in the past
I hope that my bottle will reach you
That my message gets passed
I know that there is no real reason
To hope you'll ever forgive
I know that there's no point in hoping
But still, I believe
