========================================================

Time after time
You said I was
Just wasting time

You were never a believer
In my scientists' affairs
And you always said I had never
Be someone or ever go somewhere

You always looked so worried
You always seemed so scared
You always been so horrid
Warned me from my harsh, bitter end

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why this is so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run in the end

Please don't say that I am reckless
Please don't tell me it's a crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Taking all these moments, wastin' time

I won't say that I'm not worried
I won't say I'm not afraid
I won't sell you bedtime stories
Can't real life just don't happen that way
Don't happen that way

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why this is so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

I don't care for fancy places
They are such a waste of my time
One can not serve only aces
One must make himself
A little time
One must make himself
A little time
One must make himself
A little time

Please don't say that I'm selfish
It's my perfect little crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Making all these moments truly mine

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why this is so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
When you pull that home run in, at the end
