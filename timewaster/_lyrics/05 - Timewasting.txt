========================================================

Time after time
You said that I'm
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Just wasting time
Time time time time

You were never a believer
In my scientists' affairs
And you always said I'd never
Be someone or ever go somewhere

You have always looked so worried
You have always seemed so scared
You have always been so horrid
Warned me from my harsh and bitter end

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

Please don't say that I am reckless
Please don't tell me it's a crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Taking all these moments, wasting time

I won't say that I'm not worried
I won't say I'm not afraid
I won't sell you bedtime stories
Life don't always has a happy end

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end

I don't care for fancy places
They are such a waste of time
One can not serve only aces
One must make himself a little time
One must make himself
A little time

Please don't say that I am selfish
It's my perfect little crime
Stealing hours, minuets, seconds
Making all these moments truly mine

Yes I know my time gets wasted
Is it a crime
Why's this so bad
Is it wrong to load the bases
If I you'll hit a home run at the end
