========================================================

The concept of linear time is only recent in our thinking
Since we started to count the years and the relentless ticking clock
We measured time and therefore, we defined time
But there are no straight lines in the natural world

Our World, Moon, Sun, and Seasons are all circular
Across the globe ancient cultures
Roman, Greek, Mayan, Egyptian, native American
Aboriginal Australian, Hindu, Buddhist
All believed in circular and parallel time

Does the ticking of time, then
Define what time is, or is there more to it

What would you do if you could change time
Even if it changed your very being

This is a story of one man’s quest to alter time’s events
Believing there is no better time than the alternative present
But in doing so, has he lost a world, that held everything
That was dear to him

He surfs on the ripples of time
And he plunges to the past
He hopes he can change the tomorrow
But will his hopes last
