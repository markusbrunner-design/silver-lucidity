Verse 1
Some days are brighter days
And some the darkness will fall
Some days are longer days
Some never happened at all

Chorus
And I think of you
I hear your voice
And it warms me up
But I know
I have no choice
But to carry on

Verse 2
I chased all my dreams
Down a rabbit hole
And woke up somewhere
Out of time
Floating and alone

Verse 3
No one knows what's coming now
No one has been told
I just know you're not around
And I'm so lonely and cold

Verse 4
Time is such a bitter bitch
She is such a foe
She is mean and has no heart
She took away my soul

Chorus
And I think of you
I see your face
And it warms me up
But I know it's all too much
But I can't stop
Missing you, missing us

Bridge
And time, oh after time
I was wasting time
Warned out of my harsh
And bitter end
Now it's just too late
Our destiny is set
And there is no turning back
For us no more

Outro Verse
Time is no one's slave
She will never bend
Time is not my friend
She's just my endless end
When every day I die
