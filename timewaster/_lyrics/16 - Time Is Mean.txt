So many things
I wish to say
But you are far
So far away
To endless hush
I am doomed, my dear
My words could never
Reach your ears

Time is mean
It has no heart
It took my soul
And ripped apart
The time is evil
It is cruel and fell
It didn't treat us
All that well

My unsaid words
That have no sound
Are like an airbag
In my lungs
The boots of time
Will crush them down
And time surrenders
To no one

Time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Time
Tick time tricks

The time is using
Loaded dice
It's playing catch
With us as mice
We're all as trees
Unseen high and tall
No one will hear us
Once we fall

Time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick, time tricks

Time will hit
And hurt you bad
It will not stop
Until you're dead
