Verse I
Every single day is an enigma
Never knowing how it's going to end
Every day I fight away my fears and
Every day I try to make amends
Every single man could be a rival
Every single malt's my only friend
Every single moment makes me wonder
Will it be the last I'll get to spend

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Verse III
Every single day I keep believing
That order lies within the mess
Every single lie I keep believe in
Truly makes it harder to confess

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time

Bridge
Every single day that I am breathing
Leaving trails of rubbles and distress
Every single day the grin is grimmer
On the reapers face, I'm cheating death
Every single day is a dilemma
Every single day is one more test
Every single day I fear the reaper
Reach me, catch me, cut me to the chase

Chorus
Death awaits me
Dark and fell
Will it get me
Time will tell
Immanent
A paradigm
I am doomed
For cheating time
