Verse 1
I will bend the arc of time
Fold it in and make it mine
I will build a time machine
With tech that is pure
And in pristine
I'll control the flow
Of time itself
It will bow to me
And yield
Everybody wants to rule their world

Chorus 1
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
Everybody wants the time to stop
And freeze

Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world

Verse 2
I will make myself
A time machine
I will plan it
And create
I will surf the mighty waves
Of time
I will surf the tides
Of fate

Chorus 2
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Or not yet told
Everybody knows the time won't heal
A thing
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
To change the world
Everybody wants to change their world

Bridge
All the secrets
I was sworn to keep
I must blurt out
And reveal
All the blueprints
I must bluntly snitch
All the prototypes I'll steal

Outro
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Not yet told
Oh not yet told
Everybody fears the pains the time
Will bring
Everybody wants to change their world
To rule the world
To change their world
To rule the world
To change their world
To rule the world
