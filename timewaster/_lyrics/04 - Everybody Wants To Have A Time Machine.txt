Verse I
I will bend the arc of time
Fold it in and make it mine
I wil build a time machine
Woth tech that is pure
And in prestine

Pre Chorus I
Every swithc, laser beam screw and bolt
Charge up with a million volt
I will have a time machine

Chorus I
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Everybody want the time to stop
And freeze
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world

Verse II
I will make myself
A time machine
I will plan it
And create
I will surf the mighty waves
Of time
I will surf the tides
Of fate

Pre Chorus II
Every spring and moving gear
Deadly photon's ray
In my clockworks veer
I'll control the time and sway

Chorus II
Everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write a story
Long been told
Everybody know the time
Won't heal a thing
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world
Everybody want to change the world
