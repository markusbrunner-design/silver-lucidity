========================================================

I will bend the arc of time
Fold it in and make it mine
I will build a time machine
With tech that is pure
And pristine
I'll control the flow
Of time itself
It will bow to me
And yield
Everybody wants to rule their world

And everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write the story
Long been told
Or not yet told
And Everybody wants the time
To stop and freeze

And everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
Everybody wants to change their world
Change their world

I will make myself
A time machine
I will plan it
And create
I will surf the mighty waves
Of time
I will surf the tides
Of fate

And everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write the story
Long been told
Or not yet told
And everybody knows the time won't heal
A thing

And everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
Change the world

All the secrets
I was sworn to keep
I must blurt out
And reveal
All the blueprints
I must bluntly snitch
All the prototypes
I'll steal

And everybody wants to have
A time machine
To re-write the story
Long been told

And everybody fears the pains the time
Will bring
And everybody wants to change the world

To rule their world
To change their world
To rule their world
To change their world
