========================================================

It never rains in outer space
The winds won't bring you scents of summer
You cannot tell a night from a day
You cannot tell one from the other

The outer space is cold and dark
It has no borders and no structure
The outer space is like my soul
It's hollowed out for ever after

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you endless powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Outside of time is where I roamed
To new frontiers away from Earth
I tried to find my way back home
But couldn't even find my breath

Outside of time is where I went
I searched a home a nesting shelter
I only found an endless void
A world all ruptured, a disaster

Yes all I found was endless void
Infinity of empty darkness
Infinity of pain and grief
Yes all I found was endless suffering

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers
