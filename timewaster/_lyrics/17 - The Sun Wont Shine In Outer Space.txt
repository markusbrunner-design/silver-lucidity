Verse I
It never rains in outer space
The winds won't bring you scents of summer
You cannot tell a night from a day
You cannot tell one from the other

Verse II
The outer space is cold and dark
It has no borders and no structure
The outer space is like my soul
It's hollowed out for ever after

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you endless powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Verse III
Outside of time is where I roamed
To new frontiers away from Earth
I tried to find my way back home
But couldn't even find my breath

Verse IV
Outside of time is where I went
I searched a home a nesting shelter
I only found an endless void
A world all ruptured, a disaster

Bridge
Yes all I found was endless void
Infinity of empty darkness
Infinity of pain and grief
Yes all I found was endless suffering

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers

Chorus
The sun won't shine in outer space
The sun won't give you any powers
The sun won't heat your frozen heart
It just keeps raining solar showers
