Verse I
And sometimes as I walk along
These streets that near your childhood home
I think of all those times we spent
Those days and endless nights we had

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Verse II
And once again I get the thrills
Remembering how I used to feel
When we were kids and when we roamed
The town that was our world wide home

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Bridge
And sometimes when I think of us
The time we've missed the years that passed
I know that what we had is gone
I fear to be forever lone

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know

Chorus
I miss you and I'm missing us
I missed those years that went so fast
I know I've lost you long ago
I wish I've known what now I know
