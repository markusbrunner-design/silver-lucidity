========================================================

We escape to the sand dunes
To build out our dreams

Far from all the hustle
Far from all the fuss
We trust on a better future
By changing events locked in the past

Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the past
So let it slip through our hands

In the farthest southern sun
Darkness never comes down
It’s the longest days
As we sit around
Waiting for the light to turn

Our solace in solstice
The solar rays are high
Powering our dreams
Before I take to the sky
Time is of no matter
If we reset the  past
So let it slowly pass us

The endless summer sunshine
Powers the dream machine
Fully loaded at the solstice peak
At the time stop ticks
On the solar eclipse

In the distant horizon
A dark silhouette appears
His white haired head
Halo'ed in the sun’s reflection
It draws towards our direction
