========================================================

It was 2025
I was traveling alone
Took the long ride out of town
Far from you
And far from home

Like a superhero dressed
All in crimson and indigo
I was scanning with my eyes
Everything that passed my window

I was stunned from the world
That I saw through my window
All so old yet so new
So I had just to see more
All the hustle and the fuss
Passing outside my window
At the end
I got lost
In the cold urban limbo

With acoustic old guitar
Walked the streets in endless roam
Searched for a guiding star
Under darkest skies of storm

Since I had no single clue
How to speak the local lingo
I was bound to be outcast
Like a traveling nomad weirdo

All the luxury shops
All the fancy stretched limos
Full of magic and charm
But I just wished to be home
All the hustle and the fuss
All the lightbulbs' lit windows
I got lost
I was lost
In the cold urban limbo

On the streets we're all the same
Nameless faces with no aim
Playing in this ruthless game
Honor free discharged of shame
I went thirty years ago
Yet I feel like moments passed
Since that day in which my dream
Shattered like a window's glass

All my hopes and my dreams
Like a smashed broken window
All the things I have longed
I just wished to go back home
To the future I lost
To my lost loved grass widow
I got lost
I'm so lost
In this odd time trip limbo

So I started to walk
Marched alone to the unknown
I was lost
Now I found
Found a way to get back home
