Our world is full of conflicts
Our world is filled with hate
I once thought we could mend it
I fear we are too late

I fear there is no future
For humankind on Earth
I hope we'll find salvation
Somewhere in outer space

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so deep
I hope you'll understand why
You will not join my trip

I'm writing down these words while
I'm on the launching pad
The time all swirls around me
But I am not that scared

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I'm leaving you behind me
It's hurting me so much
I hope you'll understand why
You're not aboard thIs launch

I know some will say that leaving
Is but a cowardly act
That staying is believing
That brave men do whatever it takes
I surely hope that someone
Will find this manifest
I hope you will forgive me
I really tried my best

I’m going on a time trip
I'm taking my guitar
I'll travel to the future
As much as I can, far
I hope a day will come when
You'll read and understand
I hope the time will heal you
That the time will make amends
