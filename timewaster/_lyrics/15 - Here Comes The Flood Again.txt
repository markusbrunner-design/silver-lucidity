Verse I
Heavy rain
Comes again
It's pouring long and hard
The rain just never seems to stall
Just keeps to fall

Verse II
And the winds
Storming up
The ground is almost gone
The rain just never stops at all
Just keeps to fall

Pre Chorus
Now it's just too late
Destiny is set
There is no turning back
From all the networks' fake

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Verse III
We all knew
We must pay
For all the wrongs we've done
The fire never seems to stop
It won't calm down

Pre Chorus
Now it is too late
Destiny is set
No one can make a mend
We're heading to the end

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Bridge
Now it's just too late
We lost all our faith
Our world is crushing down
We've burned it to the ground

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again

Chorus
We saw the king
Was bare and nude
But we really liked his tan
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Oh no
Here comes the flood again
We cannot stop
Or hold the rain
Hell no
Here comes the flood again
