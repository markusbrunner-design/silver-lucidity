Will I ever get to feel
While my heart is beating still
And my blood is not yet chilled
One more love, one new thrill

Will I ever get to see
How my children grow to be
Bloomin' branches in my tree
Bearing fruits of family

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told

Will I ever stop to fear
Losing all I hold so dear
Could I cease from shedding tears
Knowing that the end is near

If I'll ever get to choose
I would rather die than lose
All the memories I have
All the moments I have saved

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told

Life is too short
No one has been told
That's what people say
What the future holds
You must live it strong
Each and every day
No one has been told

No one has been promised something
No one knows how life unfolds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told

Life is too short
What the future holds
That's what people say
No one has been told
You must live it strong
Each and every day
No one has been told

No one really knows what's coming
What the future holds
No one really knows what's coming
No one has been told
