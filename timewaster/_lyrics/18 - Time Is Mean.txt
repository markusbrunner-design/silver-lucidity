Verse I
So many things
I wish to say
But you are far
So far away
To endless hush
I'm doomed, my dear
My words could never
Reach your ears

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no heart
It took my soul
And ripped apart
The time is evil
cruel and fell
It didn't treat us
All that well

Verse II
My unsaid words
That have no sound
Are like an airbag
In my lungs
The boots of time
Will crush them down
The time Surrenders
To no one

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

Bridge
The time is using
Loaded dice
It's playing catch
With us as mice
Like unseen trees
Though high and tall
No one can hear us
Once we fall

Chorus
The time is mean
It has no soul
It lends no hand
And lets you fall
And pain inflicts
In every click
In each and every
Tick time ticks

Outro
The time will hit
And hurt you bad
It will not stop
Until you're dead
