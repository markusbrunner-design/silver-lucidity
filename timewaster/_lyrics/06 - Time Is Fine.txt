Not everybody's story
Is tale of great deny
Not everyone is famous
Not all can wear a crown
Sometimes at no point in dreaming
No use to hope nor pine
Some say time isn't gracious
But I say
I say
I say, time is fine

My old folks always dreamed that
I'll turn up so immense
I'll grow to be astounding
They never gave a chance for me
To find my passion
My burning inner drive
No wonder I am shallow
I had no time
Had no time
I had no time
I had not time to thrive

Times are not always perfect
And sometimes times are cruel
Some days you'll end up heaving
While other days make you droll
So it's ok to bitch some
And sometimes even whine
But overall be grateful
Since, frankly, times are fine

That's why I am not keeping
A grudge against the world
I've learned revenge just best served when
Refrigerated cold
I've learned it serves me better
To be a friendly chap
This way I get no hard times
And take nobody's
Take nobody's
Take nobody's
Nobody's crap

I keep my goals in reason
I never rise the bar too high
For me to reach to
I wish upon no star
I know I'm no one's lighthouse
I have no urge to shine
I'm grey and I'm dull
But feel that
My time
My time is passing me by

Times are not always perfect
And sometimes times are rough
Some days can just be crappy
The goings can get tough
So it's ok to bitch some
And sometimes even whine
But overall I'm grateful
Cause maybe
Time is fine
