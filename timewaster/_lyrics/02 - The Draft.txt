Verse I
In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test the newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt

Verse II
In that test there's just one question
Which you better not get wrong
If you fail to answer, darling
Say goodbye, you're out and gone

Chorus
And that question goes as follows
Listen well and please be quick
You have little time to answer
While you hear the time clock ticks
If you'd met with baby Hitler
Knowing what his future'd be
Would you kill the little fucker
Or would you just set him free

Verse III
No one knows who wrote that poser
But there is no doubt in me
He was one shit crazy little bustard
And as smart as one can be

Verse IV
There's a reason why I'm saying
That this riddle is so tough
Is because that once you've solved it
They release you from their draft

Chorus
Cause you see my friend there's really
No solution to this quiz
You can't kill the baby Hitler
Yet you must not let him live
Hell, the only thing you should say
When the choices are proposed
To this question I won't answer
Both these options I oppose

Bridge
It's this kind of situation
In which one could never win
Kill the baby really means that
You can't kill him to begin
If you kill that seed of evil
Time continuum will cease
Since you'd never kill that baby
Have he not done what he did

Chorus
And that question goes as follows
Listen well and please be quick
You have little time to answer
While you hear the time clock ticks
If you'd met with baby Hitler
Knowing what his future'd be
Would you kill the little fucker
Or would you just set him free

Verse V
And that thing just makes me crazy
All that time loop paradox
If one can't change past for better
Travel time is but a hoax

Ending Chorus
In the first day of recruiting
At The Time Trip School of Art
There's a test all newbies go through
It's the hardest one, no doubt
In that test there's just one question
Which I answered right headlong
I became a Traveling agent
How I wish that I'd got it wrong
