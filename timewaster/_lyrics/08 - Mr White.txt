Mr White knows he's right
He has to intervene
Ha cannot let chase your dream
You cannot have your time machine
You can't control the flow of time
He has to hold the history line

You can't control the past
You cannot make the first the last

There is an order to the universe
And the order will be his
Mr White - knows he's right

This time daemon
Will be scheming
To control all your dreaming
He can't exist
If you persist
On changing the time events

What is here now
Can only ever be
From what the past has sent
Time cannot be bent

He takes delight without reveal his
R - eversable
A - dversable
B-  eyond
B - oundaries
I - mmersed
i - n
T - ime
Machine

Out of the dessert he comes
From his time and his space he roams
He has no home, but for you
He has a RABBIit hole
