Section 1
Mr White knows he's right
He has to intervene
Ha cannot let chase your dream
You cannot have your time machine
You can't control flow of time
He has to hold the history line

Section 2
You cannot change the past
You cannot make the first the last

Section 3
There is an order to the universe
And the order will be his
Mr White knows he's right
To intervene before your flight

Section 4
This time daemon
Will be scheming
To control all your dreaming
He can't exist
If you persist
On changing the time events

Section 5
What is here now can only be
From what the past has sent

Section 6
He takes delight without reveal his

Section 7
Out of the dessert he comes
From his time and his space he roams
He has no home but for you
He has a RABBIiT hole
