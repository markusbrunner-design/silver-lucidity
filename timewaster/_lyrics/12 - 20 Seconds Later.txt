I remember being told
Time is cradle of the world
How it all began with blast
How we're all but cosmic dust

I remember me and mom
And vacations in the farm
I remember me and dad
Building castles in the sand

I remember Truly do
How I set my eyes on you
Wrapped in childish
Scarf and gloves
And 20 seconds later
It was love

I remember you and me
Swimming naked in the sea
I remember pushes, shoves
When we danced in all those clubs

Yes I vividly recalls
Sunny summers windy falls
Having fun just all the same
When the cold cold winters came

I remember long ago
Smoking chimneys, misty glow
Chilly nights and falling snow
And a sprig of mistletoe
I remember frosty hoar
How you opened up the door
And your father earnest stare
As I walked with you up stairs

I remember to this day
How you asked if I could stay
How you set my heart on flames
How I knew you felt the same
And 20 seconds later
We made love

I remember to this day
How you begged of me to stay
How I said I won't be long
How I switched those switches on
And 20 seconds later
I was gone

20 decades Part us
Time goes on
