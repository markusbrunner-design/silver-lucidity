Verse I
If I could look at the future
What would I see
Would It be joy and laughter
Or only death and debris

Pre Chorus
The time is my bitter rival
The time is my foe
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never slows

Chorus
I've surfed on the ripples of time and
I've plunge to the past
I hoped I could change the tomorrow
But my hopes didn't last
I know now there isn't a future
In which we'll both get to live
I know there is no point in dreaming
But still, I believe

Verse II
If I could see the tomorrow
What would I see
Would it be grief and sorrow
Or would it be glee

Bridge
I've surfed on the waves of the time and
I've plunged in the past
I hoped I could change the future
I tried, but alas
I know now there's no real tomorrow
In which I'll meet you again
I feel there is no point in living
While I'm drowning in pains

Pre Chorus
The time is my bitter rival
The time's not my friend
My death has a time of arrival
And the time never bends

Chorus
I've surfed on the surges of the time and
I got lost in the past
I hope that my bottle will reach you
That my message gets passed
I know that there is no real reason
To hope you'll ever forgive
I know that there's no point in hoping
But still, I believe
