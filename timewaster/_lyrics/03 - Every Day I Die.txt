Early morning, a cup of tea
Sunny skies I can not see
Life all packed in a cardboard box
A total shock, no hallway talks

All around me long-faced friends
We all share the same bitter end
Good hard workers that can barely stand
Hammered down to no amend

And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
If you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
But I wake in fear each night
Every day I die

All those human working bees
All these cubic office hives
Everyone just says I should
Take it calm, that I'll survive

But I really followed through
And I know what fate devise
Grasping air, that's all I do
While I wait the long cold dive

And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
When you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
Breaking into tears each night
Every day I die

As the sun is setting fast
Spreading darkness veil
I can't find an escaping route
From these depths of hell
Maybe I just played it wrong
Don't know how or why
I will never end up dead
It's: Every day I die
