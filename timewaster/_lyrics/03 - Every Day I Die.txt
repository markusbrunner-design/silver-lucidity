Verse I
Early morning, a cup of tea
Sunny skies I still can't see
My Life's all packed in a cardboard box
A total shock and no hallway talks

Verse II
All around me long-faced friends
We all share the same bitter end
Good hard workers that can barely stand
Been hammered down to no amend

Chorus
And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
If you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
But I wake in fear each night
Every day I die

Verse III
All those human working bees
All these cubic office hives
Everyone just say I should
Take it calm, that I'll survive

Bridge
But I really followed through
And I know what fate devise
Grasping air, that's all I do
While I wait the long cold dive

Chorus
And I fear I'll never see
Yet another tide
Life is not a turning wheel
When you're cast aside
I just need to find my breath
Heaven knows I tried
Breaking into tears each night
Every day I die

Ending Chorus
As the sun is setting fast
Spreading darkness veil
I can't find escaping route
From these depths of hell
Maybe I just played it wrong
Don't know how or why
I will never end up dead
Every day I die
