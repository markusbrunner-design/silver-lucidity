Verse I
If you have a dream
If you have a goal
You can come with me
To the rabbit hole
If you want to learn
And to know it all
Then you better crawl
Down the rabbit hole

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me
Through the rabbit hole

Verse II
Come and take my hand
Careful you might roll
All the way deep down
Down the rabbit hole
Let me guide you through
I won't let you fall
I won't let you leave
You can beg and crawl

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me
Through the rabbit hole

Bridge
I won't charge you much
For this trip my doll
Maybe just your life
Maybe just your soul
It's not much to pay
It's not much at all
For a ride with me
Through the rabbit hole

Chorus
If you'll take a bite
From my bait, you might
Come with me Tonight
Through the rabbit hole
If you'll bite my bait
You could have it all
Now come down with me
Through the rabbit hole
