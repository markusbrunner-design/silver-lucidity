I run from coast to coast
Beast of despair in his black cloak
Has his paws around my throat
Follows me like an evil ghost
An evil ghost
From coast to coast

You let me go. You let me down
You let me go. You let me down
Down and down and down I fell
A drowning man on his way to Hell

I run from coast to coast
Beast of despair in his black cloak
Has his paws around my throat
Follows me like an evil ghost
An evil ghost
From coast to coast

I left my home. I left my friends
I left my home. I left my friends
Round my neck the hangman's rope
You gonna croak, the joker joked

Love is passion. Love devours
Love is pain. Love overpowers
Love is sweet then turns sour
Can't do with or without her

I run from coast to coast
Beast of despair in his black cloak
Has his paws around my throat
Follows me like an evil ghost
An evil ghost
From coast to coast

You let me go. You let me down
You let me go. You let me down
Down and down and down I fell
A drowning man on his way to Hell

I run from coast to coast
Beast of despair in his black cloak
Has his paws around my throat
Follows me like an evil ghost
An evil ghost
From coast to coast
An evil ghost
From coast to coast

        <pre class="lyrics">
Love, light, have abandoned our side
Leaving us dull without will to thrive
Lives pass uneventfully by
Anything challenging set aside

Stand by, let the tension arrive
Grateful receive what deceit provides
This vice is a sinful ally
Fading to black every glimpse of light

When the heart is young and the will is strong
You expect yourself to conquer
But the winds of time will disperse the signs
That you left to find your trail

In the waters of sin
I will drown my awareness of you
You have always been there
Covering the sun
Aching in my chest

Someday I will do as you say
Cracking my armour to break away
All blame I assign to myself
Carrying the guilt of a doom we share

When the heart is young and the will is strong
You expect yourself to conquer
But the winds of time will disperse the signs
That you left to find your trail

In the waters of sin
I will drown my awareness of you
You have always been there
Covering the sun
Aching in my chest

You're my shadow within
And I'll give what I harvest to you
In the river of shame
Certain we immerse
Preying on the blessed

In the waters of sin
I will drown my awareness of you
You have always been there
Covering the sun
Aching in my chest
