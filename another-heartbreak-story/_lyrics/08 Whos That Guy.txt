Intro
With my very best friend 
On her wedding day
She looks so happy
I feel so blue 
On my own again
What else is new

Ch
Who's that guy looking my way
All alone, No fiancée
Maybe it's my lucky day
I won't be betrayed


V1
He's tall. He's got class and style
A lovely warm smile
He asks me to dance
Can I take the chance
He's funny, He's charming
Could this be romance
Could this be romance

Ch
Who's that guy looking my way
All alone, No fiancée
Maybe it's my lucky day
I won't be betrayed

V2
We dance The band slowly plays
A soft serenade
A magical night
It all feels so right
And maybe, just maybe
It's love at first sight
It's love at first sight

Outro
I've started hoping
The next wedding day 
Is going to be mine
Is going to be mine
The next wedding day 
Is going to be mine
Is going to be mine
