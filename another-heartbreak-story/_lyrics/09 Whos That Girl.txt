V1
Best friend's wedding and I'm feeling blue
I'm here on my own. What else is new
People are laughing, drinking their wine
I'm pretending everything's fine
Oh my God, it's time to dance
Should I take one last chance? One last chance

Ch
Who's that girl? Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm falling in love again

V2
Can't believe it, she's looking my way
Maybe today's my lucky day
I'm standing here like I'm in a trance
She stabbed my heart with a single glance
Did she give me a sign
I wanna make her mine
I gotta make her mine

Ch
Who's that girl? Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
I'm falling in love again
Think I'm in love again

V3
The band is playing something slow
I walk over to her, say hello
Tell me, would you care to dance with me
She smiles and my heart skips several beats
Something tells me this
Will be a true romance
Will be a true romance

Outro
Next wedding will be mine
We'll be together till the end of time
