V1 0:29- 1:04
My best girl upped and ran away
So lost, I stayed in bed all day
I'd never make it on my own
The house looked like a freakin' war zone 
Cold slices of pizza everywhere 
Clothes on the floor, I didn't care   

Ch 1:06 - 1:45
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
I'm a single man
But I'm making brand-new plans

V2 1:45 -2:20
I learned to shop, I learned to cook
I learned from YouTube and from books
Learned to recycle, how to clean
Learned how to use the washing machine
My house is now my joy and pride
Just need a new girl by my side

Ch 2:20 - 3-06
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
I'm a single man
But I'm making brand-new plans

Bridge 3:06 - 3:45
Sometimes when things go wrong 
You come out of it twice as strong
The sun will shine after the rain
You'll be back on your feet again
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast

Ch 3:4 5 -4:30 
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
Making brand-new plans
I'm a single man
Making brand-new plans
