Looking for love on the Internet
I couldn't believe my eyes
Your profile was perfect
And when we met
No bad surprise
I thanked my lucky stars
We were matched
Like Venus and Mars

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Disillusion on the Internet
Different photos
Same girl
You posted two profiles
I was in shock
End of the world
You were two-timin' me
You broke my heart
Shattered my dream

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Hidin' in Cyberspace
Digital masks for the face
False charms and true lies
Deformin' mirrors deceive the mind's eye
False charms and true lies
False charms and true lies

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
