Looking for love on the Internet
Couldn’t believe my eyes
Your profile was perfect
And when we met - no bad surprise
I thanked my lucky stars
We were matched like Venus and Mars

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Disillusion on the Internet
Different photos – same girl
You posted two profiles
I was in shock - end of the world
You were two-timing me
You broke my heart, shattered my dream

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Hiding in Cyberspace
Digital masks for the face
False charms and true lies
Deforming mirrors deceive the mind’s eye
False charms and true lies
False charms and true lies

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
