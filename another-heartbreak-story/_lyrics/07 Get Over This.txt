========================================================

I hate to see you feeling down
You know that girl
She just messed you around
She didn't do right by you 
It's about time you came to
We've been mates since high school
You gotta stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Come out tonight, we'll paint the town red
You gotta get that girl out of your head
Look at them babes over there
Short, short skirts, and long blonde hair
That one there looks really cool
You gotta stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Hey bro, listen to me
I gotta make you see
Don't waste your precious life
Stop looking for a wife

Wife
Wife
Wife

You gotta get
You gotta get
You gotta get over this
