The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

We lived together
Goin' same direction
We'd live forever
Love was our protection
Then came the infection
No one could explain
Then came the sickness and the pain
Then came the sickness and the pain

The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

Why is life so unfair
Why is it a nightmare
What's the good of sayin' prayers
No one answers
No one cares
Why is life so unfair

You lie on your sick bed
Close to your last breath
I hold your cold, cold hand
This wasn't what we planned
I just can't understand
All I can feel is anger and rage
All I can feel is anger and rage

The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die
