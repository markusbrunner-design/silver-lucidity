I loved that girl
From our first date
I didn't know 
I'd sealed my fate
I trusted her
But I was wrong
I was far too weak
She was far too strong

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

I just can't bear
To be alone
She just don't care
Her heart's of stone
In our old caf√©
My coffee's cold
The sky is all grey
I'm feeling old

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love traps the heart in heavy chains
You swear you won't get caught again
But you know without true love so sweet
Your life will never be complete

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love comes and goes
Why, no one knows
Some doors open
Some doors close
