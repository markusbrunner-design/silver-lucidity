Your profile on the Internet
Really caught my interest
Lots of things to explore
This is what I signed up for

It all went wrong on our first date
You had no car - Turned up late
Took me to some run-down bar
This ain’t what I signed up for

Profile after profile
Night after night
So many losers
on this site
Never gonna find Mr. Right

You got no money, you’re no fun
You always lost, never won
Just can’t take it any more
This ain’t what I signed up for

It can’t work out between us two
It’s over now. I’m through with you
Watch me walk out of the door
You ain’t what I signed up for

Profile after profile
Night after night
So many losers on this site
Never gonna find Mr. Right

Be careful what you sign up for
Gotta choose better, choose better
