Ch
The grim reaper
The grim reaper
Took you away
I just got to know you
But my love was true
The light’s gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die

V1
We lived together
We’d live forever
Going the same direction
Love was our protection
Then came the infection
No one could explain
Then came the sickness and the pain
Then came the sickness and the pain

Bridge
Why is life so unfair
Why is it a nightmare
What’s the good of saying prayers
No one answers. 
No one cares
Why is life so unfair

V2
You lie on your sick bed
Close to your last breath
I hold your cold, cold hand 
This wasn’t what we planned
I just can’t understand
No one can explain
All I can feel is anger and rage
All I can feel is anger and rage

Ch
The grim reaper
The grim reaper
Took you away
I just got to know you
But my love was true
The light’s gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
