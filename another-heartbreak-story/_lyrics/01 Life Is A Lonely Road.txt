========================================================

Come into this world
Defenceless 
Forced from a tranquil
Waterworld 
Into the light
Gasping for air 
No idea what we're
Doin' there
What we're doin' there

Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

Leave this world
Insignificant
Hopin' there will be
An afterworld 
In the dark night
Where there
Is no air 
No idea what will
Happen there 
What will happen there 

Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

No control over space or time
Livin' out our puppet lives 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone
