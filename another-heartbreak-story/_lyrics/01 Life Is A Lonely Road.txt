Come into this world defenceless
Forced from a tranquil waterworld
Into the light gasping for air 
No idea what we’re doing there
What we're doing there

Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home
Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home

Leave this world insignificant 
Hoping there’ll be an afterworld
In the dark night where there is no air
No idea what will happen there
What will happen there

Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home
Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home

No control over space or time
Living out our puppet lives
If you are by my side
I can pretend I have a home
Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don’t let me travel all alone
