V1
Come into this world defenceless 
Forced from a tranquil waterworld 
Into the light gasping for air 
No idea what we're doing there What we're doing there 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 

Ch
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

V2
Leave this world insignificant 
Hoping there'll be an afterworld 
In the dark night where there is no air 
No idea what will happen there 
What will happen there 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 

Ch
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone I
f you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

Outro
No control over space or time 
Living out our puppet lives 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone
