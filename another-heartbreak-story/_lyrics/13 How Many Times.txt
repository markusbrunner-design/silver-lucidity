V1 0:10 -0:48
I didn't know what love was about
Just couldn't seem to work it out  
Girls would always take me for a ride
I woke up with a dent in my pride

0:30
Then I found you. So warm and bright
But from this life you've taken flight
Your death made a great hole in my soul
A hole in my soul. A hole in my soul

Ch 0:51
How many times
Tell me, how many times
How many times
Tell me, how many times
How many times
Can a heart be broken
A heart be broken, before it dies
Before it dies

V2
Loneliness cuts through me like a knife
There is no meaning in my life
It's too hard being on my own 
Feel like my heart is turning to stone

1:36
Memories of you in every place
At night, I miss your warm embrace
Your voice in my ears, sweet and low
Calls me to you everywhere I go

Ch
How many times
Tell me, how many times
How many times
Tell me how many times
How many times
Can a heart be broken
A heart be broken, before it dies
Before it dies

Bridge
Love makes you glad
Love drives you mad
Love lifts you up
Love brings you down
Love lets you fly
Love makes you cry
You may get hurt and you may regret
But love is a feeling you'll never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you'll never forget

Ch
How many times
Tell me, how many times
How many times
Tell me how many times
How many times
Can a heart be broken
A heart be broken, before it dies
