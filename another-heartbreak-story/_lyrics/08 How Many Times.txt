========================================================

I didn't know what love was about
Just couldn't seem to work it out  
Girls would always take me for a ride
I woke up with a dent in my pride

Then I found you
So warm and bright
But from this life you've taken flight
Your death made a great hole in my soul
A hole in my soul
A hole in my soul

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

Loneliness cuts through me like a knife
There is no meanin' in my life
It's too hard bein' on my own 
Feel like my heart
Is turnin' to stone

Memories of you in every place
At night, I miss your warm embrace
Your voice in my ears, sweet and low
Calls me to you everywhere I go

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

Love makes you glad
Love drives you mad
Love lifts you up
Love brings you down
Love lets you fly
Love makes you cry
You may get hurt
And you may regret
But love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never 
Never forget

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
