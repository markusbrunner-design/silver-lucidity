V1
I fell in love with you 
On that very first night
My heart it beat so fast 
You were my Mr. Right

You were funny and kind
You said you loved me too
You were gentle but strong
You made my dreams come true 

Ch 
Farewell, my lover
Farewell my friend
My time has come
Our story must end
Be grateful for the love we had
Don't (don't) be sad

V2 
The two of us were one 
We shared our hopes and fears
No way we could have known
It would all end in tears

The crab came stalking me
Silently in my veins
Discovered far too late 
My body was in chains

Ch
Farewell, my lover
Farewell my friend
My time has come
Our story must end
Be grateful for the love we had
Please don't be sad
Be grateful for the love we had
Please don't be sad

Outro
I fell in love with you 
On that very first night
My heart it beat so fast 
You were my Mr. Right

The two of us were one 
We shared our hopes and fears
No way we could have known
It would all end in tears
In Tears
