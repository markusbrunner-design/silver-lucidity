V1
I hate to see you feeling down
You know that girl
She just messed you around
She didn't do right by you 
It's about time you came to
We've been mates since high school
You gotta stop being a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Chorus
Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

V2
Come out tonight, we'll paint the town red
You gotta get 
That girl out of your head
Look at them babes over there
Short, short skirts, and long blonde hair
That one there looks real cool
You gotta stop being a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Chorus
Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Bridge
Hey bro, listen to me
I gotta make you see
Don't waste your precious life
Stop looking for a wife

Outro Instrumental + ad lib vocals 
You gotta get over this 
You gotta get over this to fade
