Best friend's weddin'
And I'm feelin' blue
I'm here on my own
What else is new
People are laughing
Drinkin' their wine
I'm pretending everything is fine
Oh my God
It's time to dance
Should I take one last chance

Who's that girl
Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated  
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm fallin' in love again

Can't believe it
She's lookin' my way
Maybe today's my lucky day
I'm standin' here
Like I'm in a trance
She stabbed my heart
With a single glance
Did she give me a sign 
I wanna make her mine
 
Who's that girl
Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated  
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm fallin' in love again

The band is playin' something slow
I walk over to her
Say hello
Tell her
Would you care to dance 
She smiles at me and shakes my hand
Somethin' stupid tells me this
I never ever want to miss
Her again
Her again

The next wedding will be mine
We'll be together
Till the end of time
