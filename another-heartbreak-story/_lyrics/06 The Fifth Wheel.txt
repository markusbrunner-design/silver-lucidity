V1 
My best friend's face is full of pride
I'm by his side as we await his bride
The church is packed. The music starts
He looks so happy. It breaks my heart

V2 
Clergyman asks me for the rings
I hand them over as the choir sings
The newlyweds exchange a kiss
I never felt more lonely than this

Interlude

Ch
However hard I try
It seems that love
Has passed me by
Right now, I just feel
I'll always be the fifth wheel
The fifth wheel

V3 
I wave goodbye as bride and groom 
Set off on their loving honeymoon 
I'm jealous of their happiness
As I sink back into loneliness

Interlude
Ch
However hard I try
It seems that love
Has passed me by
Right now, I just feel
I'll always be the fifth wheel
The fifth wheel

Transition 
Bridge  
Love is a mystery I don't understand
It crumbles to dust in my hands
Every time I think this is the one
Every time I think her heart is won
All of my hopes. All of my dreams
Always end up ripped at the seams
Surely somewhere there is a girl
Who'll be the one to change my world

Interlude
Ch
However hard I try
It seems that love
Has passed me by
Right now, I just feel
I'll always be the fifth wheel
The fifth wheel
