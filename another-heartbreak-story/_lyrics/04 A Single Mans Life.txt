My best girl upped
And ran away
So lost, I stayed in bed all day
I'd never make it on my own
The house looked like a freakin' war zone 
Cold slices of pizza everywhere 
Clothes on the floor
I didn't care
On the floor
I didn't care
I didn't care

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived

I learned to shop
I learned to cook
I learned from YouTube
And from e-books
Learned to recycle
How to clean
Learned how to use
The washing machine
My house is now my joy and pride
Just need a new girl by my side
Just need a new girl
Just need a new girl
A new girl

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived

Sometimes when things go wrong 
You come out of
Twice as strong
The sun will shine after the rain
You'll be back on your feet again
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
