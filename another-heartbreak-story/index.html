[Main Male Protagonist]

Come into this world defenceless 
Forced from a tranquil waterworld 
Into the light gasping for air 
No idea what we're doing there What we're doing there 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 

If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

Leave this world insignificant 
Hoping there'll be an afterworld 
In the dark night where there is no air 
No idea what will happen there 
What will happen there 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 

If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone I
f you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

No control over space or time 
Living out our puppet lives 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone

[Main Male Protagonist]

Looking for love on the Internet
Couldn’t believe my eyes
Your profile was perfect
And when we met - no bad surprise
I thanked my lucky stars
We were matched like Venus and Mars

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Disillusion on the Internet
Different photos – same girl
You posted two profiles
I was in shock - end of the world
You were two-timing me
You broke my heart, shattered my dream

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Hiding in Cyberspace
Digital masks for the face
False charms and true lies
Deforming mirrors deceive the mind’s eye
False charms and true lies
False charms and true lies

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

I loved that girl
From our first date
I didn't know 
I'd sealed my fate
I trusted her
But I was wrong
I was far too weak
She was far too strong

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

I just can't bear
To be alone
She just don't care
Her heart's of stone
In our old café
My coffee's cold
The sky is all grey
I'm feeling old

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love traps the heart in heavy chains
You swear you won't get caught again
But you know without true love so sweet
Your life will never be complete

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love comes and goes
Why, no one knows
Some doors open
Some doors close

[Main Male Protagonist]

My best girl upped and ran away
So lost, I stayed in bed all day
I'd never make it on my own
The house looked like a freakin' war zone 
Cold slices of pizza everywhere 
Clothes on the floor, I didn't care   

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
I'm a single man
But I'm making brand-new plans

I learned to shop, I learned to cook
I learned from YouTube and from books
Learned to recycle, how to clean
Learned how to use the washing machine
My house is now my joy and pride
Just need a new girl by my side

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
I'm a single man
But I'm making brand-new plans

Sometimes when things go wrong 
You come out of it twice as strong
The sun will shine after the rain
You'll be back on your feet again
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
Oh, I survived
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
Making brand-new plans
I'm a single man
Making brand-new plans

I hate to see you feeling down
You know that girl
She just messed you around
She didn't do right by you 
It's about time you came to
We've been mates since high school
You gotta stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Come out tonight, we'll paint the town red
You gotta get that girl out of your head
Look at them babes over there
Short, short skirts, and long blonde hair
That one there looks really cool
You gotta stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool
Stop being such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Hey bro, listen to me
I gotta make you see
Don't waste your precious life
Stop looking for a wife

Wife
Wife
Wife

You gotta get
You gotta get
You gotta get over this

V1
Best friend's wedding and I'm feeling blue
I'm here on my own. What else is new
People are laughing, drinking their wine
I'm pretending everything is fine
Oh my God, it's time to dance
Should I take one last chance

Ch
Who's that girl? Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated  
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm falling in love again

V2
Can't believe it, she's looking my way
Maybe today's my lucky day
I'm standing here like I'm in a trance
She stabbed my heart with a single glance
Did she give me a sign 
I wanna make her mine
I gotta make her mine
 
Ch
Who's that girl? Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm falling in love again 

V3
The band is playing something slow
I walk over to her, say hello
Tell her, would you care to dance 
She smiles at me and shakes my hand
Something stupid tells me this
I never ever want to miss
Her again
Her again

Outro
The next wedding will be mine
We'll be together till the end of time

Ch
The grim reaper
Reaper
Took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light’s gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

V1
We lived together
Going same direction
We’d live forever
Love was our protection
Then came the infection
No one could explain
Then came the sickness and the pain
Then came the sickness and the pain

Ch
The grim reaper
Reaper
Took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light’s gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

Bridge
Why is life so unfair
Why is it a nightmare
What’s the good of saying prayers
No one answers
No one cares
Why is life so unfair

V2
You lie on your sick bed
Close to your last breath
I hold your cold, cold hand 
This wasn’t what we planned
I just can’t understand
All I can feel is anger and rage
All I can feel is anger and rage

Ch
The grim reaper
Reaper
Took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light’s gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

V1 0:10 -0:48
I didn't know what love was about
Just couldn't seem to work it out  
Girls would always take me for a ride
I woke up with a dent in my pride

0:30
Then I found you. So warm and bright
But from this life you've taken flight
Your death made a great hole in my soul
A hole in my soul. A hole in my soul

Ch 0:51
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

V2 
Loneliness cuts through me like a k nife
There is no meaning in my life
It's too hard being on my own 
Feel like my heart is  turning to stone

1:36
Memories of you in every place
At night, I miss your warm embrace
Your voice in my ears, sweet and low
Calls me to you everywhere I go

Ch
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

Bridge
Love makes you glad
Love drives you mad
Love lifts you up
Love brings you down
Love lets you fly
Love makes you cry
You may get hurt and you may regret
But love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never 
Never forget

Ch
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
