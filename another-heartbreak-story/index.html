[Main Male Protagonist]

Come into this world
Defenceless 
Forced from a tranquil
Waterworld 
Into the light
Gasping for air 
No idea what we're
Doin' there
What we're doin' there

Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

Leave this world
Insignificant
Hopin' there will be
An afterworld 
In the dark night
Where there
Is no air 
No idea what will
Happen there 
What will happen there 

Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 

No control over space or time
Livin' out our puppet lives 
If you are by my side 
I can pretend I have a home 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone 
Life is such a lonely road 
Don't let me travel all alone

[Main Male Protagonist]

Looking for love on the Internet
I couldn't believe my eyes
Your profile was perfect
And when we met
No bad surprise
I thanked my lucky stars
We were matched
Like Venus and Mars

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Disillusion on the Internet
Different photos
Same girl
You posted two profiles
I was in shock
End of the world
You were two-timin' me
You broke my heart
Shattered my dream

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

Hidin' in Cyberspace
Digital masks for the face
False charms and true lies
Deformin' mirrors deceive the mind's eye
False charms and true lies
False charms and true lies

Why did I fall for her
Why did I fall in love
Why did she lie to me
Was I just too blind to see
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start
How do you mend a broken heart
Where do you even start

I loved that girl
From our first date
I didn't know 
I'd sealed my fate
I trusted her
But I was wrong
I was far too weak
She was far too strong

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

I just can't bear
To be alone
She just don't care
Her heart's of stone
In our old caf√©
My coffee's cold
The sky is all grey
I'm feeling old

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love traps the heart in heavy chains
You swear you won't get caught again
But you know without true love so sweet
Your life will never be complete

Why did she break
My lovin' heart
Why was she fake
Why did we part
She was so cruel
I was a fool
Why did she break
I just can't take

Love comes and goes
Why, no one knows
Some doors open
Some doors close

[Main Male Protagonist]

My best girl upped
And ran away
So lost, I stayed in bed all day
I'd never make it on my own
The house looked like a freakin' war zone 
Cold slices of pizza everywhere 
Clothes on the floor
I didn't care
On the floor
I didn't care
I didn't care

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived

I learned to shop
I learned to cook
I learned from YouTube
And from e-books
Learned to recycle
How to clean
Learned how to use
The washing machine
My house is now my joy and pride
Just need a new girl by my side
Just need a new girl
Just need a new girl
A new girl

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived

Sometimes when things go wrong 
You come out of
Twice as strong
The sun will shine after the rain
You'll be back on your feet again
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast
If you choose to live in the past
You're just getting nowhere fast

I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived
I'm a single man
It wasn't my plan
She left me high and dry
But I survived
I'm makin' brand-new plans
Yes, I survived

I hate to see you feelin' down
You know that girl
She just messed you around
She didn't do right by you 
It's about time you came to
We've been mates since high school
You gotta stop bein' such a fool
Stop bein' such a fool
Stop bein' such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Come out tonight, we'll paint the town red
You gotta get that girl out of your head
Look at them babes over there
Short, short skirts, and long blonde hair
That one there looks really cool
You gotta stop bein' such a fool
Stop bein' such a fool
Stop bein' such a fool

Girls they come and girls they go
Why that is, I just don't know
But I'm sure of one thing now
They ain't worth the trouble anyhow
You gotta get over this
You gotta get over over this
You gotta get over this
Get over this

Hey bro, listen to me
I gotta make you see
Don't waste your precious life
Stop looking for a wife

Wife
Wife
Wife

For a wife

Wife
Wife
Wife

You gotta get
You gotta get
You gotta get
You gotta get over this

You gotta get
You gotta get
You gotta get over this

Best friend's weddin'
And I'm feelin' blue
I'm here on my own
What else is new
People are laughing
Drinkin' their wine
I'm pretending everything is fine
Oh my God
It's time to dance
Should I take one last chance

Who's that girl
Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated  
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm fallin' in love again

Can't believe it
She's lookin' my way
Maybe today's my lucky day
I'm standin' here
Like I'm in a trance
She stabbed my heart
With a single glance
Did she give me a sign 
I wanna make her mine
 
Who's that girl
Who's that girl
She has green, green eyes
And red, red curls
She's so sophisticated  
Sipping her champagne
I'm so intoxicated
Think I'm in love again
I'm fallin' in love again

The band is playin' something slow
I walk over to her
Say hello
Tell her
Would you care to dance 
She smiles at me and shakes my hand
Somethin' stupid tells me this
I never ever want to miss
Her again
Her again

The next wedding will be mine
We'll be together
Till the end of time

The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

We lived together
Goin' same direction
We'd live forever
Love was our protection
Then came the infection
No one could explain
Then came the sickness and the pain
Then came the sickness and the pain

The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

Why is life so unfair
Why is it a nightmare
What's the good of sayin' prayers
No one answers
No one cares
Why is life so unfair

You lie on your sick bed
Close to your last breath
I hold your cold, cold hand
This wasn't what we planned
I just can't understand
All I can feel is anger and rage
All I can feel is anger and rage

The grim reaper
Reaper took you away
I just got to know you
But all my love was true
The light's gone from my life
You were too young to die
Too young to die
Too young to die

[Main Male Protagonist]

I didn't know what love was about
Just couldn't seem to work it out  
Girls would always take me for a ride
I woke up with a dent in my pride

Then I found you
So warm and bright
But from this life you've taken flight
Your death made a great hole in my soul
A hole in my soul
A hole in my soul

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

Loneliness cuts through me like a knife
There is no meanin' in my life
It's too hard bein' on my own 
Feel like my heart
Is turnin' to stone

Memories of you in every place
At night, I miss your warm embrace
Your voice in my ears, sweet and low
Calls me to you everywhere I go

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies

Love makes you glad
Love drives you mad
Love lifts you up
Love brings you down
Love lets you fly
Love makes you cry
You may get hurt
And you may regret
But love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never forget
Love is a feeling you will never 
Never forget

How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
How many times
Tell me, how many times
Can a heart be broken
Before it dies
